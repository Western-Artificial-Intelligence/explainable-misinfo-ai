fake,scientists have found an unexpected use for virtual reality headsets to help pinpoint people who may later develop alzheimers disease the devices widely used by computer gamers display images that can be used to test the navigational skills of people thought to be at risk of dementia those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to alzheimers later in life scientists now believe by identifying potential patients far earlier than is possible at present researchers hope it should then become easier in the long term to develop treatments aimed at halting or slowing their condition it is usually thought memory is the first attribute affected in alzheimers said project leader dennis chan a neuroscientist based at cambridge university but difficulty with navigation is increasingly recognised as one of the very earliest symptoms this may predate the onset of other symptoms by pinpointing those who are beginning to lose their navigational skills we hope to show that we can target people at a much earlier stage of the condition and one day become far more effective in treating them the discovery that loss of navigational skills was associated with alzheimers disease was made several years ago by chan and colleagues based at several centres in the uk these studies used tablet computers to test navigational tasks but now scientists plan to take their tests to a new level with the use of the virtual reality sets in which wearers are immersed in simulated environments through which they must navigate around 300 people aged between 40 and 60 will be recruited to take part in the study some will have a gene that puts them at risk of the condition or will come from a family with a history of alzheimers not all will be destined to be affected by the disease however chans project aims to find out who will wearing virtual reality headsets participants will be asked to navigate their way towards and then remember details of a series of different environments we will make a note of those who have particular problems and see if these are the ones who are at higher risk of developing alzheimers explained chan the aim of the study is very simple can we detect changes in brain function before people are aware that they have them researchers recently pinpointed the significance of a tiny area of the brain known as the entorhinal cortex which acts as a hub in a widespread brain network that controls navigation this now appears to be the first part of the brain that succumbs to alzheimers the entorhinal cortex is the first brain region to show degeneration when you get alzheimers and that is where we shall be focusing our research said chan whose work is funded by the alzheimers society the goal of the work is to help people as they develop the disease to date drug trials for alzheimers have been applied when people have already got dementia by which time considerable damage to the brain has already occurred chan told the observer if we can develop drugs and administer them earlier for instance before the disease has spread beyond the entorhinal cortex then this would have the potential to prevent the onset of dementia virtual reality to help detect early risk of alzheimers
fake,a chicago couple who previously suffered two miscarriages recently welcomed a healthy baby boy thanks to a breakthrough new fertility test which helps women struggling with achieving a successful pregnancy by examining the mothers dna the test is offering new hope to many familys struggling to conceive carolyn bilson and tim obrien met three years ago and say it was love at first sight literally a month later we knew we wanted to have children bilson told good morning america abc news but after two miscarriages bilson then pushing 40 said the couple sought help from a fertility specialist in chicago who recommended in vitro fertilization their first attempt at ivf however failed too according to bilson i think it was just so devastating because we didnt anticipate that she said we thought the hard part would be getting pregnant not staying pregnant obrien added that the most frustrating thing was that you didnt learn anything from the previous miscarriage so there wasnt what could we do differently the couple then learned about a new way to tailor fertility treatments specifically to the dna of the mother using a test that can help couples figure out the perfect time for conception based on that dna abcnewscom the endometrial receptivity test uses a tissue sample to look at 238 genes to find out the optimum time for conception thus increasing the couples chance to conceive for bilson that time is two days later than the average woman dr ilan turkaspa an obgyn and the director of chicagos institute for human reproduction described the process as personalized medicine abc news this is what we are trying to do here by personalized medicine turkaspa said adding that you can make sure that the uterus is ready and optimize a time for implantation the result their beautiful baby westley who is now nine months old were so lucky bilson said were so blessed abc news obgyn dr jessica shepherd told gma that this breakthrough new treatment is very exciting to the medical community because it offers another avenue for women who have recurrent miscarriages to potentially get pregnant when it is something they never thought they could look forward to the new technique works by having a doctor take a sample of the womens endometrial tissue which you can get dna from and from that dna you can tell what part of the cycle is prime time to take the fertilized egg and implant it via ivf shepherd added shepherd said that the ideal candidates are women who have had three or more miscarriages or women over 40 but emphasized that the test is not for everyone and infertility is a spectrum one risk of the procedure many women may not take into account is the emotional effects of it not working and you still miscarrying shepherd said it is a new process and important to go over the risks of the procedure which can vary per person with your health care provider how a breakthrough new fertility test is offering hope for families who have suffered miscarriages

fake,the ageold answer to inventing a cure for cancer hasnt quite happened yet but science took another large leap forward the us food and drug administration announced monday night it granted accelerated approval to vitrakvi larotrectinib a treatment for adult and pediatric patients whose cancers have a specific genetic feature biomarker this is the second time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker across different types of tumors rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated in laymans terms it means doctors and researchers can attack cancer at the root of biographical markers in a body rather than focusing on one point where a tumor originated like the breast colon or other cancerous organ todays approval marks another step in an important shift toward treating cancers based on their tumor genetics rather than their site of origin in the body said fda commissioner scott gottlieb md this new siteagnostic oncology therapy isnt specific to a cancer arising in a particular body organ such as breast or colon cancer its approval reflects advances in the use of biomarkers to guide drug development and the more targeted delivery of medicine we now have the ability to make sure that the right patients get the right treatment at the right time this type of drug development program which enrolled patients with different tumors but a common gene mutation wouldnt have been possible a decade ago because we knew a lot less about such cancer mutations the early beginnings of larotrectinib was studied in three clinical trials that included 55 pediatric and adult patients with solid tumors that had an identified ntrk gene fusion without a resistance mutation and were metastatic or where surgical resection was likely to result in severe morbidity according to the fdas statement these patients had no satisfactory alternative treatments or had cancer that progressed following treatment larotrectinib demonstrated a 75 percent overall response rate across different types of solid tumors these responses were durable with 73 percent of responses lasting at least six months and 39 percent lasting a year or more at the time results were analyzed examples of tumor types with an ntrk fusion that responded to larotrectinib include soft tissue sarcoma salivary gland cancer infantile fibrosarcoma thyroid cancer and lung cancer vitrakvi received an accelerated approval which enables the fda to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is thought to predict a clinical benefit to patients further clinical trials are required to confirm vitrakvis clinical benefit and the sponsor is conducting or plans to conduct these studies using our breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval processes we support innovation in precision oncology drug development and the evolution of more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients the fda stated this is especially true when it comes to pediatric cancers were committed to continuing to advance a more modern framework of clinical trial designs that support more targeted innovations across disease types based on our growing understanding of the underlying biology of diseases like cancer common side effects reported by patients in clinical trials receiving vitrakvi include fatigue nausea cough constipation diarrhea dizziness vomiting and increased ast and alt enzyme blood levels in the liver health care providers are advised to monitor patient alt and ast liver tests every two weeks during the first month of treatment then monthly and as clinically indicated women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take vitrakvi because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby patients should report signs of neurologic reactions such as dizziness cure for cancer fda announces new aggressive drug attacking originating genes
fake,scientists are inching closer to a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially lifethreatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption while the drug is not being hailed as a cure for peanut allergy it has proven successful in building up patients tolerance to peanuts over time lessening the potential for lifethreatening complications were excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it said allergist stephen tilles md acaai former president study coauthor and consulting advisor for aimmune therapeutics according to eurekalert our hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day many would tolerate as much as two peanuts we were pleased to find that two thirds of people in the study were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day after nine to 12 months of treatment and half the patients tolerated the equivalent of four peanuts fda warns against honey pacifiers after texas infants hospitalized with rare illness the results which were presented sunday at the college of allergy asthma and immunology annual scientific meeting and published in the new england journal of medicine were based on study participants ranging in age from 4 to 55 years old all participants who mostly fell between ages 4 and 17 had a peanut allergy but one third received a placebo while the rest were given a peanut protein powder that increased in dose over time participants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a boardcertified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge ofc reactions from the oral challenges at the end of the study were much milder than prior to treatment tilles said according to eurekalert on average the participants were able to tolerate a 100fold higher dose of peanut at the end of the study than they did at the beginning in addition the symptoms caused by the 100fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study experts children at risk of lead poisoning in chattanooga with fda approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies the studys authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy this is not a quick fix and it doesnt mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want jay lieberman md vice chair of the acaai food allergy committee and study coauthor said according to eurekalert but it is definitely a breakthrough the hope would be to have a treatment available in the second half of 2019 if that happens people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures potential lifesaving peanut allergy drug on horizon scientists say

fake,cnn a fiveminute neck scan could predict a persons risk of developing dementia a full decade before symptoms emerge researchers have said the test which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline according to the study by scientists at university college london ucl who presented their work sunday at the american heart associations annual scientific conference a group of almost 3200 patients aged 5874 had ultrasounds on their necks in 2002 before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to 14 years from 2002 to 2016 people with the most intense pulses which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow were up to 50 more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions the research found because the strength with which blood traveled into their brains caused damage to the brains network of blood vessels pulses become more intense when arteries near the heart are worn down usually by lifestyle factors such as poor diet and drug use and can no longer cushion the blood flow coming from the heart if you can detect the risk in people in midlife it really gives an impetus to those people to change their lifestyle said dr scott chiesa postdoctoral researcher at ucl whats good for the arteries is good for the brain he added in summary of his findings dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging how you live your life has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline if the findings are confirmed by larger studies they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age and the scans would be well set up for routine testing according to chiesa its very easy to do and its very quick to do when healthy arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain but damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells over time the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study what we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia said carol routledge director of research at alzheimers research uk who was not involved in the research vascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain and this can also play a role in the development of alzheimers disease studies have found those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia dementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function alzheimers disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases around 50 million people suffer from dementia worldwide according to the world health organization with numbers projected to rise to 152 million by 2050 in the united states the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults according to the us centers for disease control and prevention while in the uk it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death according to the office for national statistics promising findings the studys findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people so its promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development said paul edwards director of clinical services at dementia uk but he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis saying the elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia there is currently no cure for dementia though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms often a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information no followup appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next previous studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level but its effects remain largely incurable more research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia while these findings are interesting as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be said routledge routledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking only consuming alcohol within recommended limits staying active monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain dementia fiveminute neck scan can spot symptoms earlier

fake,en espaol by dennis thompson healthday reporter sunday sept 30 2018 healthday news its a perfect case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend a potentially dangerous bacteria appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer a small preliminary study reports the bacteria clostridium novyint can cause gas gangrene and sepsis if infection is allowed to run amok in a wound but when injected into a tumor clostridium novyint appears to both attack the cancer directly and encourage the bodys immune response against the cancer cells said lead researcher dr filip janku he is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in houston patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and in some patients clinically meaningful activity janku said clostridium novyi has been linked to human illness in 2000 the us centers for disease control and prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the united kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria the strain used in this clinical trial clostridium novyint had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin which can be lethal in humans janku said the nt stands for nontoxic clostridium novyi flourishes in lowoxygen environments researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site normal tissues even if they are low on oxygen they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate janku explained cancerous tissue is low in oxygen most often in the center of the cancers to test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of clostridium novyint ranging from 10000 to 3 million spores fifteen of the patients had sarcoma two patients had melanoma and seven had a variety of cancers the researchers said the scientists expected clostridium novyint to help fight the tumor in two ways first the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells janku said if that happens it actually helps to increase the presence of tumorspecific antigens which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system janku said it can prime the immune system to attack the cancer the bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didnt kill off tumor cells janku added patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the clostridium novyint janku said clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics janku noted the bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients with tumor cells dying off as a result tumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients however janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed making the lesion appear larger than it actually is following bacterial therapy cancer stabilized in 21 patients when both injected and uninjected lesions were included the stable disease rate was 86 percent the researchers reported the potential for clostridium novyint to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing said sacha gnjatic who is associate director of the human immune monitoring center at mount sinai in new york city thats where the promise of this type of therapy lies you would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because youre disrupting the tumor cells gnjatic said what would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the noninjected tumors thats the holy grail of immunotherapy janku said hes particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas which are cancers that occur in bone muscle and soft tissues classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesnt seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas janku explained researchers have moved on to the next phase in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab keytruda will also be treated with a single injection of clostridium novyint janku said the researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers however they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from clostridium novyint janku added two patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of clostridium novyint fell ill with sepsis andor gas gangrene leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores researchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked janku said that didnt result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region but its a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients janku said patients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects such as low blood pressure or fever he added the trial results were to be presented sunday at the international cancer immunotherapy conference in new york city the meeting is jointly sponsored by the cancer research institute the association for cancer immunotherapy the european academy of tumor immunology and the american association for cancer research research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peerreviewed journal more information the us national cancer institute has more about cancer treatment doctors use bacteria as weapon against cancer

fake,medical marijuana can provide relief from symptoms from dozens of health conditions with minimal negative side effects according to new research two studies published recently in the journals frontiers in pharmacology and medicine found that patients with health conditions such as chronic pain and insomnia saw statistically and clinically significant therapeutic benefits when they used medical cannabis according to a press release from the university of new mexico researchers from the university studied data obtained through the releaf app this app developed by several of the studies authors is the largest repository of userentered information on the consumption and effect of cannabis use in the united states the release states it has almost 100000 entries the app is designed to record how using marijuana corresponds to changes in the intensity of symptoms and any side effects a person experiences it helps track and learn which types of cannabis dosing and ingestion methods work best the study published in frontiers in pharmacology found that users suffering from 27 different health conditions with symptoms ranging from seizures to depression reported a mean reduction in symptoms of 28 to 46 points on a zero to 10 point scale after consuming cannabis in various forms including concentrates and topicals people using the drug to treat anxiety and depressionrelated symptoms reported more relief than people with pain symptoms in the second study researchers examined how cannabis buds treated insomnia cannabis users on the releaf app experienced a reduction of symptom severity of an average 45 points on a zero to 10 point scale according to the study people who consumed the drug via pipes and vaporizers experienced greater relief of symptoms and those who vaped experienced fewer negative effects according to the release data from the app showed that an overall 94 percent of cannabis users suffering from a variety of health conditions reported that the intensity of their symptoms was reduced after consuming the drug additionally use of marijuana was associated with nonserious side effects if the results found in our studies can be extrapolated to the general population cannabis could systematically replace multibillion dollar medication industries around the world it is likely already beginning to do so jacob vigil coauthor of the studies said in the release study medical marijuana relieves range of symptoms with no serious side effects

fake,one single dose of cannabidiol a chemical extracted from cannabis decreases brain abnormalities in people with psychosis according to a study published wednesday by kings college london in jama psychiatry cannidiboil also referred to as cbd acts in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms the chemical is a nonintoxicating compound found in cannabis researchers examined participants who were experiencing psychotic symptoms but had not yet been diagnosed with psychosis as well as healthy patients some subjects with symptoms were given placebo while others received a single dose of cbd all the participants then underwent an mri scan while performing a memory task that engages regions of the brain related to psychosis a press release stated results from the mri scans showed that participants displaying psychotic symptoms had abnormal brain activity compared to healthy participants however those that had received cannabidiol showed decreased abnormal activity compared to those who received the placebo these results suggest that cbd can help readjust brain function to normal levels the researchers arent entirely sure how cbd works in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms but the results show that it has a therapeutic effect according to the press release the mainstay of current treatment for people with psychosis are drugs that were first discovered in the 1950s and unfortunately do not work for everyone sagnik bhattacharyya coauthor of the study said in the release our results have started unravelling the brain mechanisms of a new drug that works in a completely different way to traditional antipsychotics a previous kings college london study also discovered that the chemical has antipsychotic effects and in june the us food and drug administration approved the first medication made from cannabidiol to treat two rare forms of epilepsy cannabidiol reduces symptoms of psychosis
fake,lets talk about your test results my neurologist said she looked as if she had good news instead it was shocking the carotid artery on the left side of my neck one of the brains two main sources of blood and oxygen was clogged with fatty plaque the doctor said the artery was almost completely blocked there must be a mistake i thought frantically i exercise and am healthy and young actually im 68 but you know a young 68 you are in danger of a major stroke she said and need an operation immediately the irony wasnt lost on me as a journalist covering the medical field i have spent years writing about strokes most of which are caused by clots blocking blood flow to the brain now i faced the unnerving question am i going to become a weird punch line as in did you see that the guy who writes all those stories about strokes just had a big one a blocked carotid artery didnt seem possible for an active person like me ive never smoked ive run lifted weights or done something aerobic like playing tennis pretty much every day of my life i watch what i eat i even wrote an article about how i kept my bad cholesterol in check with diet and exercise not medication while im addicted to cheese and my weight has climbed some ive eaten foods like salmon and oatmeal with fervor for more than 20 years so i figured i was exempt from medical crises the diagnosis made me reconsider dilemmas that had once seemed academic for example should older americans be screened for blocked carotid arteries critical paths the carotid arteries are passageways through which blood and oxygen move to a persons brain and face when fatty plaque obstructs an artery the blood supply can be reduced or cut off sometimes resulting in a stroke internal carotid arteries internal external supply blood to brain blockage caused by fatty plaque external carotid arteries blood flow supply blood to face and neck common detail common carotid arteries external internal internal carotid arteries supply blood

to 130000 deaths annually in the us and are the primary preventable cause of disability according to the american stroke association carotid disease is a main cause of those strokesnearly 200000 strokes a year vascular specialists say yet 80 of those patients have no symptoms before the strokes in 2014 a us task force concluded that people with no symptoms dont have to be screened for carotid disease saying that the risks such as poor surgery outweigh the benefits but the task forcea panel of private doctors assigned by law to help set us medical policyfocused on screening in the general population not older patients the task force said there arent enough carotidcaused strokes to warrant screening everyone of course not everyone with carotid blockage will get surgery thousands of people with the condition can benefit from drug therapy my experience along with some evidence from screening of thousands of individuals raises questions about the task forces conclusions the society for vascular surgery recommends screening people over 65 with coronary disease high blood pressure or a history of smoking the task force generally supports screening americans for breast cancer with 253000 new cases in women and 41000 estimated deaths annually as well as colorectal cancer with 135000 new cases and 50000 deaths a year government and private insurance pay to screen for these illnesses but not for carotid screening of nonsymptomatic people which can cost about 70 a person after hearing the jarring news about my dangerously blocked carotid i faced a big decision my wife christa and i live near washington dc our daughter maddie was supposed to be married in san francisco in june a week after the neurologist told me i needed surgery right away suddenly the prospect of being at the wedding seemed iffy conventional wisdom says that among the 65andolder set only those with symptoms should be tested that often means individuals who have had ministrokes which tend to be brief periods in which the patient has something wrong on one side of the body usually for a few minutes symptoms often include slurred speech temporary vision loss a onesided facial droop and arm or leg weakness or numbness vascular surgeon george lavenson jr wrote in 2012 in the journal for vascular ultrasound that among 22146 people screened for carotid disease during four public screening campaigns between 2001 and 2006 about 75 were found to have blockage of 60 or moreenough to warrant treatment with medication it is hard to understand how many leaders in the medical profession can object to a one to twominute accurate screen of seniors that can find the 75 with silent carotid artery disease dr lavenson said those patients can be evaluated and managed to prevent them from being one of the 700000 clotcaused strokes we continue to have annually most doctors would have put me in the asymptomatic or lessrisky category but five years ago i went out for a run of about 7 miles along the potomac river at the end of the run my right leg started shaking that seldom happened again until the past few months when it started recurring more often along with shaking in the right arm my physician joel taubin recommended a neurologist rhanni herzfeld of the neurology center in washington she prescribed tests to discern the cause of the shaking perhaps a pinched nerve incipient epilepsy a neurological disorder or a tumor the results ruled them all out then an mri of my head showed a few white spots on the left side dr herzfeld wondered if i might have had some silent strokes sending tiny bits of artery plaque floating to my brainand now appearing as white spots on the scan fatty plaque accumulates in most peoples arteries and can form clots that break off and can cause strokes dr herzfeld ordered a carotid ultrasound of the arteries on both sides of my neck its a quick painless and very accurate scan moments later we were talking in her office my right carotid artery was perfectly clear she said the left was almost completely blocked and i needed immediate surgery to clear it i asked if we could treat the obstruction with antiplatelet medication such as plavix no your blockage is just too extensive dr herzfeld said she recommended that bruce a perler a professor of vascular surgery at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore do the procedure the effectiveness of carotidartery surgery in people without symptomsbut major blockagewas established two decades ago by the asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis trial funded by the national institutes of health it showed in hospitals in the us and canada that the risk of stroke or death in surgery patients after a median 27 years was 51 less than half that of people treated only with drugs an international study published in 2010 in the lancet showed similar benefits from surgery i consulted with other doctors including one who said this isnt quite an emergency but its urgent the operation is serious with the rates of stroke and death within 30 days after surgery totaling about 24 in major studies examined by the task force the task force noted that this typical measure can be as high as 5 at some lowvolume hospitals people considering this operation should ask their hospital surgeon or academic medical center about their rates of stroke and death after surgery few hospitals and surgeons in the us publish their individual results dr perlers rate was well under 1 he said my risk of stroke was 10 to 15 over five years probably in the first year a week before maddies wedding my wife and i met with dr perler at johns hopkins on the drive to baltimore we called maddie she sounded frightened and i told her maybe i wouldnt need surgeryor could put it off we also told her brothers jamie and will and her sister samantha what was going on dr perlers test confirmed dr herzfelds findings i definitely needed surgery my artery was almost completely obstructed by echolucent plaquea type that can easily form clots break off and cause strokes we discussed timing dr perlers next surgery day was june 18 that would leave me four days to recover before the wedding he warned that i would be miserable doing that but his next surgery day after that wasnt until june 27 you can safely wait until next week he said but i wouldnt wait two months then he added the words i remember most well take good care of you my wife and i decided on june 27and headed to san francisco for the wedding it was an untraditional ceremony with no white veil or a parade of bridesmaids maddie wore a champagnecolored beaded dress i have never seen her so happyexcept maybe when she was playing my little pony as a 6yearold i was simply happy to be there tom burton and his daughter maddie at her wedding to dan powers at san francisco city hall in june less than a week before mr burtons surgery to unblock a carotid artery photo christina richards photography on the morning of june 27 dr perler started operating at 730 within two hours he had cleared the plaque from my carotid artery later he told me it was so cloggedabout 99he couldnt even detect a pulse in it when i woke up i was relieved to see that my eyes and fingers all worked i could think and speak clearly i was even able to complain to the nurses about how lousy i felt i spent two days in intensive care with my blood pressure surging at times about two weeks after the operation i felt pretty normal ive resumed running and weightlifting i recently played golf for the first time since the surgery and feel great but mostly i feel lucky to have gotten a test that may have saved my life getting screened a national company life line screening will do a carotid screen for 70 or with other tests such as for aortic aneurysms for 149 hospitals accredited labs will do carotid ultrasound tests typically for 200 to 300 but usually only on a doctors order insurers private and government generally will pay only if the patient has symptoms including a ministroke the society for vascular surgerys site vascularorg can direct people to specialists who can do testing write to thomas m burton at tomburton com the

fake,from chaos to calm a life changed by ketamine enlarge this image maria fabrizio for npr maria fabrizio for npr for six years now life has been really good for james he has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in new york city he enjoys spending time with his wife and kids and it has all been possible he says because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine before ketamine james was unable to work or focus his thoughts his mind was filled with violent images and his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes ketamine helped me get my life back says james who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career ketamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s and almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mindbending party drug but ketamines story took a surprising turn in 2006 when researchers at the national institutes of health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours since then doctors have prescribed ketamine off label to thousands of depressed patients who dont respond to other drugs and pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketaminerelated drugs to treat depression johnson johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting meanwhile doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression and there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety bipolar disorder posttraumatic stress disorder and perhaps even obsessivecompulsive disorder i think its actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time says dr martin teicher an associate professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school and director of the developmental biopsychiatry research program at mclean hospital ketamine may also offer new hope for people like james who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders james had a happy childhood he says but his thoughts were out of control i always felt like i was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me he says he spent much of his childhood terrified of an unknown an ambiguous force out there the fear was overwhelming he says i literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until i went to college and there was something else about james his body temperature i overheated constantly he says i would wear shorts all year long in my 20s in my apartment i would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter in his late 20s james saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder so he started taking stimulants at first the pills helped him focus then they didnt no matter how many he took hed done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry but now james was trying to work at home and it wasnt going well adhd pills will make you interested in anything he says so i was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart i was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart i was going in a massive downward spiral james had always suffered from mood swings but now they were rapid and extreme and he couldnt stop thinking about gruesome scenarios like a murderer coming for his family my wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me he says she would go to work for a few hours then rush home there would be times id call her just screaming please come home i cant get through another minute eventually james found his way to dr demitri papolos an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at albert einstein college of medicine he was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office papolos says he was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat papolos diagnosed james with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the fear of harm phenotype it typically appears in childhood and often doesnt respond to traditional psychiatric drugs but papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine its been transformational he says in january papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem they inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week nearly all got dramatically better scientists still arent sure why ketamine works but theres evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire to alter the connections between cells that process has been linked to recovery from depression and it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders i think its having multiple effects and that means its probably useful for multiple different disorders teicher says one of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation and that could explain why patients like james usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine james started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day he says his response was dramatic one day i turn to my wife and im like i feel calm today i dont know if its the sun coming in i dont know if its just the way were sitting here but i feel like i could go and sit at the computer and work the next day james did sit down at his computer a month later he was back at work from chaos to calm a life changed by ketamine
fake,a blood test for 10 different types of cancers could one day help doctors screen for the disease before patients show symptoms researchers at the worlds largest gathering of oncologists have said the test called a liquid biopsy screens for cancer by detecting tiny bits of dna released by cancer cells into blood the test had particularly good results for ovarian and pancreatic cancers though the number of cancers detected was small researchers hope the test will become part of a universal screening tool that doctors can use to detect cancer in patients this is potentially the holy grail of cancer research to find cancers that are currently hard to cure at an earlier stage when they are easier to cure said dr eric klein lead author of the research from cleveland clinics taussig cancer institute we hope this test could save many lives the study by a research team that also included scientists from stanford university was presented at the annual conference of the american society of clinical oncologists in chicago simon stevens the chief executive of nhs england said new techniques such as cancer blood tests could unlock enormous survival gains as well as dramatic productivity benefits in the practice of medicine now as the nhs marks its 70th anniversary we stand on the cusp of a new era of personalised medicine that will dramatically transform care for cancer and for inherited and rare diseases said stevens the research scrutinised the cases of more than 1600 people 749 of whom were cancerfree at the time of the study with no diagnosis and 878 of whom had been newly diagnosed with a disease the test was most accurate for diagnosing pancreatic ovarian liver and gallbladder cancers correctly finding the diseases in at least four out of five patients the blood test found lymphoma and myeloma with slightly less accuracy at 77 and 73 and bowel cancer in two out of three patients lung cancer was detected in 59 of patients head and neck cancer was detected in 56 of patients researchers said their results showed promise in the approach of blood screenings for cancer but noted further clinical development was needed the number of patients in whom cancers were detected was small for example although the test detected ovarian cancer with 90 accuracy only 10 ovarian cancers in total were detected nevertheless researchers aim to develop a tool that could be used by for all people regardless of their family history potentially this test could be used for everybody said klein prof nicholas turner from the institute of cancer research in london described the findings as really exciting and as a possible universal screening tool far too many cancers are picked up too late when it is no longer possible to operate and the chances of survival are slim he said the goal is to develop a blood test such as this one that can accurately identify cancers in their earliest stages klein added it is several steps away and more research is needed but it could be given to healthy adults of a certain age such as those over 40 to see if they have early signs of cancer holy grail of cancer research doctors positive about early detection blood test

fake,scientists have announced the development of a highly accurate and reliable technique for diagnosing prostate cancer the dundee universitybased team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography swe to detect prostate tumours the method is noninvasive and cheaper than current detection techniques prostate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the uk one in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47000 new cases being diagnosed every year men aged 50 or over men with a family history of prostate cancer and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition current diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients said the dundee university teams leader professor ghulam nabi our new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery the prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate known as a digital rectal examination or dre mri scans a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostatespecific antigen psa in the blood facebook twitter pinterest stephen fry who has had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour says he is excited by the new diagnostic test photograph hglgc images each carries problems psa results can be unreliable a dre is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment mri scans cannot always give a definitive answer while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive the new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour we have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as mri added nabi the technique has picked up cancers which mri did not reveal we can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous where it is and what level of treatment it needs this is a significant step forward the trial tests involved around 200 patients now we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer nabi said swe technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases however to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team the technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer said simon grieveson head of research funding at prostate cancer uk which funded the dundee project with support from the movember foundation with an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the uk the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever theresa may launches 75m drive against prostate cancer read more in the past few years a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease including michael parkinson ian mckellen and most recently stephen fry the comedian and former rector of dundee university who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour this breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the uk not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence said fry it is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging 47000 number of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed every year in the uk 11000 the number of men who die each year from the disease 1 in 8 proportion of uk men who will get prostate cancer in their lifetime prostate cancer breakthrough as uk team develops more accurate test

fake,researchers report some of the most encouraging results yet for treating lung cancer with the latest immunebased treatments most of which have been approved to treat other types of tumors in three papers presented at the american association for cancer research annual meeting and published simultaneously in the new england journal of medicine lung cancer experts found innovative ways to weaken lung tumors to improve peoples chances of surviving the disease there is definitely a high unmet need says patrick forde assistant professor of oncology and associate member of the bloombergkimmel institute for cancer immunotherapy at johns hopkins of the lack of effective treatments for lung cancer currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return and chemotherapy typically leads to only a 5 improvement in peoples chances of living five years but an up to 70 chance of being exposed to serious toxicities health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now the studies involve a group of immunebased cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system the medications target a protein called pd1 its related pdl1 or ctla4 which protect the bodys cells from being killed by immune cells because tumors are normal cells growing out of control they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells a series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs first approved in 2011 initially for treating melanoma expose the tumor cells to the immune system based on their success in treating skin cancers scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers including tumors in the lung in one study called checkmate227 researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer nsclc nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immunebased drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment after nearly a year the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was 42 less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy whats more say the studys authors doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the twodrug combination of nivolumab opdivo and ipilimumab yervoy and which are not in the study he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress currently lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each persons disease in order to improve their chances of survival for example newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a persons cancer doctors can also determine if a persons lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors more than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precisionbased treatments says dr matthew hellmann of the memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc lead author of the study in addition a year after treatment three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy the results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced nsclc by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first as many doctors currently do while nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic nsclc for example that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy this combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment instead of chemotherapy get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now

please check your spam folder there may also be other ways to improve outcomes for people with advanced nsclc in another study researchers found that combining standard chemotherapy with another immunebased checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab keytruda helped them live nearly four months longer on average than people treated with just chemotherapy people getting the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were 51 less likely to die after 105 months than people receiving chemotherapy alone the magnitude of benefit was unexpected and great to see says dr leena gandhi associate professor of medicine at nyu langone medical center and coauthor of the study pembrolizumab is already approved for treating about 25 to 30 of people with advanced nsclc who have a certain genetic profile that makes their cancer vulnerable to the drug but this latest study expands that population to many more people who may benefit from the immunotherapy if the medication is combined with chemotherapy the results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer in a third small study of 21 people diagnosed with early stage disease researchers led by a team at johns hopkins and mskcc found that giving people two doses of nivolumab before surgery to remove lung tumors shrunk those tumors drastically and lowered chances of relapse thanks to its ability to jump start the immune system to fight the cancer when the scientists analyzed the tumors they had cut out they found that in about half of the people treated with nivolumab the growths showed significant destruction by immune cells meaning that nivolumab had unmasked the tumors as foreign and allowed the immune systems killer cells to attack them and when the scientists studied the blood of the people receiving the immunotherapy they discovered a close match between the types of immune cells in the blood and certain targets on the tumor cells suggesting that nivolumab had released the immune system to pump out the appropriate cells it needed to tackle the cancer we expected to see some response but i dont think we expected to see a 45 significant response says forde to give you some idea of how significant that is with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around 20 of the time forde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in retraining the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time possibly even a lifetime the holy grail is to have a relatively nontoxic therapy that could potentially use the bodys own immune system to prevent recurrence he says and while our study is only with 21 patients the early indications from this study are very positive taken together the results could fundamentally change the way lung cancer is treated significantly improving peoples ability to both hold off lung cancer for longer periods of time as well as live longer with the disease contact us at editors com immune treatments show promise for lung cancer

fake,blood and urine test believed to be first of its kind could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders scientists in britain say they have developed a blood and urine test that can detect autism in children researchers at the university of warwick said the test believed to be the first of its kind could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders asd in children who could then be given appropriate treatment much earlier in their lives asds mainly affect a persons social interaction and communication with symptoms that can include speech disturbances repetitive andor compulsive behaviour hyperactivity anxiety and difficulty adapting to new environments as there is a wide range of asd symptoms diagnosis can be difficult and uncertain particularly at the early stages of development it is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the uk has asd with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls scientists said their research found a link between asd and damage to proteins in blood plasma they found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma which found children with asd had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine dt and certain sugarmodified compounds called advanced glycation endproducts ages genetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of asd while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors mutations and rare genetic variants however researchers believe their new tests could reveal yettobeidentified causes of asd they also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with asd the warwick team worked with collaborators at the university of bologna in italy who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with asd along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12 blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis the warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups working with a further collaborator at the university of birmingham the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between asd and healthy controls the outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method they said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify asd at very early stages indicate how the asd is likely to develop further to more severe disease and assess if treatments were working the research was led by naila rabbani reader of experimental systems biology at the university of warwick who said our discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention we hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors with further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles or fingerprints of compounds with damaging modifications this may help us improve the diagnosis of asd and point the way to new causes of asd the research has been published in the journal molecular autism note added 27 february 2018 the uk autism research charity autistica provided the following comment to the guardian this is a small earlystage study which may explain one biological difference in autism at this stage the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism for example we dont know whether this technique can distinguish autism from adhd anxiety or other similar conditions there have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism still the best way to diagnose autism is through clinical interview and observation which takes into account the many features of autism new test can detect autism in children scientists say
fake,remarkable thats how researchers are describing the results of a new study done on mice displaying traits associated with alzheimers disease the deletion of just a single enzyme saw the near total reversal of the deposition of amyloid plaques found in brains of those with alzheimers improving cognitive functions in the mouse subjects according to the study from researchers at the cleveland clinic published feb 14 in the journal of experimental medicine these promising research findings center around deleting a gene that produces an enzyme called bace1 which helps make the betaamyloid peptides that accumulate abnormally in the brains of people with alzheimers disease studies have shown that stopping or reducing that enzymes activity dramatically reduces production of betaamyloid peptides which are toxic to the brain and lead to the symptoms including memory loss associated with alzheimers by using bace1 inhibitors to gradually lower the enzymes levels researchers saw reduced neuron loss and better brain function in the mice offering hope for human subjects down the line according to the study cleveland clinic lerner research via journal of experimental medicine however researchers urge caution with the results as many alzheimers discoveries seem to hold true in mice then fail in people cleveland clinic researcher riqiang yan phd an author on the study told abc news that in the mouse model the gene that produces the enzyme was deleted completely stopping the enzymes production but in humans its unlikely that bace1 inhibitors would totally halt the enzymes production yan said nonetheless five bace1 inhibitors are being tested in human subjects currently yan added bace1 inhibitors are still hopeful for ad patients if they have no unwanted side effects or can be tolerated for longterm use yan said yan added researchers are currently in phase ii and in some cases phase iii clinical trials for the various compounds dr jaysheree allen is a family medicine resident physician at the mayo clinic in minnesota and a resident at the abc news medical unit alzheimers disease reversed in mice offering hope for humans new research shows
fake,a japanese drug company is offering up a big claim shionogi co says it has an experimental pill that can kill the flu virus within a single day according to news reports in a clinical trial a single dose of the drug made by the pharmaceutical company eliminated the virus from peoples bodies in a median time of 24 hours the wall street journal reported both japanese and american flu patients were included in the trial the experimental drug worked three times faster than another antiviral drug tamiflu the company told the journal the drug uses a different approach to fight the flu than other medications the flu virus spreads through the body by invading cells once inside a cell it hijacks the cells machinery forcing the cell to make copies of the virus then the newly copied viruses break out of the cell spreading to other cells nearby and repeating the process this flu season could be worst in a decade existing drugs including tamiflu work to block these viral copies from escaping the cell the journal reported the experimental drug however kicks into action earlier working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place the journal said japanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in japan by early march the journal reported the drugmaker plans to apply for approval in the us this summer however the drug likely wouldnt be available here until next year read more at the wall street journal originally published on live science could this experimental drug stop the flu in 24 hours
fake,researchers have developed an ultraviolet uv lamp that kills the influenza virus but isnt harmful to human skin or eyes according to a new study in scientific reports they hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places such as schools hospitals and airports weve known for a century that uv light is extremely efficient at killing microbes bacteria and viruses says study leader david brenner director of the center for radiological research at columbia university irving medical center for that reason uv devices are often used for sterilization for medical equipment in hospitals for example or drinking water for backcountry campers but conventional germicidal lamps arent safe for humans to be around with prolonged exposure they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes so up until now theyre only really practical when people arent around say brenner you can sterilize a hospital room but not when anyones inside about five years ago brenner says the columbia team came up with a potential solution light on the far end of the uvc spectrum known as faruvc has very short wavelengths the researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses but cant travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes we wanted to get all the benefits of uv light in terms of killing microbes but none of the health hazards says brenner earlier studies on animals and humans have shown that exposure to faruvc light does indeed appear to be safe we havent seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells whereas with conventional uv light weve always seen lots of biological damage he says previous research has also shown that faruvc light can kill mrsa bacteria a common cause of infections after surgery now brenner and his colleagues have show that uvc light can effectively kill airborne influenza in their new study aerosolized particles of the h1n1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of faruvc light the light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal uv light while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active we think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting says brenner think about doctors waiting rooms schools airports and airplanesany place where theres a likelihood for airborne viruses and unlike the flu vaccine he says faruvc light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes including newly emerging virus strains brenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp which could become a costeffective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level the lamp were using at the moment costs less than 1000 and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation the price would drop dramatically he says we

clinical settings as well in the operating room during surgeries for example no matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like mrsa says brenner if you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound brenner cant predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available but he says hes extremely optimistic about the technology there has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces and this is an approach that may solve that problem contact us at editors com this uv lamp could prevent the flu virus from spreading in public places
fake,en espaol monday feb 12 2018 healthday news as a particularly nasty flu season rages across the united states scientists have found a powerful new disinfectant that makes light work of the virus researchers say a certain spectrum of ultraviolet light called faruvc easily kills airborne flu viruses while posing no risk to people it could offer a new inexpensive way to eliminate airborne flu viruses in indoor public spaces such as hospitals doctors offices schools airports and aircraft said the team from columbia university medical center in new york city the disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed said lead research david brenner but he believes the use of overhead lowlevel faruvc light in public locations would be a safe and efficient method for limiting the transmission and spread of airbornemediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis as the researchers explained broadspectrum uvc light kills viruses and bacteria and it is currently used to decontaminate surgical equipment but this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts so its not used in public spaces however brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light faruvc might be a safer option in prior studies they found that faruvc light killed methicillinresistant s aureus mrsa bacteria a common and dangerous superbug without harming human or mouse skin in this new study they found that faruvc light also killed airborne h1n1 virus a common strain of flu virus faruvc light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer deadcell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye so its not a human health hazard said brenner who directs columbias center for radiological research however because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells faruvc light can reach their dna and kill them he said in a university news release lamps with this type of uv light currently cost less than 1000 brenner said but that price would likely fall if the lamps were massproduced and unlike flu vaccines faruvc is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes even newly emerging strains he said two flu experts were encouraged by the findings the prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using faruv radiation is very exciting said dr michael grosso chief medical officer at huntington hospital in huntington ny though handwashing remains critically important it does not prevent every instance of transmission grosso said immunization and antiviral medications are also important but again have limitations it appears that lowdose faruv light is safe and effective and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of diseasecausing viruses dr len horovitz a pulmonary specialist at lenox hill hospital in new york city agreed he noted that the technologys cost is not prohibitive and it is safe this use can sterilize the air in a public space reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses the findings were published online feb 9 in the journal scientific reports more information the us centers for disease control and prevention has more on flu shining a deadly new light on airborne flu virus

fake,you dont have to break a sweat to reap the health benefits of physical activity according to new research in the journal of the american geriatrics society in a study of women age 65 and older just 30 minutes a day of light exerciselike running errands and cleaning the housewas linked to a lower risk of death moderateintensity exercise like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking was associated with an even greater reduction in risk the authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life the paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active says senior author andrea lacroix professor of family medicine and public health at the university of california san diego for the study lacroix and her colleagues asked 6000 women ages 65 to 99 to wear activitytracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities the women were then followed for an average of three years health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now based on the data from the womens activity trackers the researchers found that those who got at least 30 minutes of light physical activity a day were 12 less likely to die compared to those who got less those who got an additional 30 minutes of moderate activity were 39 less likely to die light physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isnt sitting down walking to the mailbox strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry activities like these account for more than 55 of older adults daily activity says lacroix so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news weve always been told that this type of activity isnt enough to do you good says lacroix but what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a womans risk of dying over the next three to four yearsand we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderatetovigorous physical activity more times guide to exercise the study could not show a causeandeffect relationship between activity level and risk of death only an association but the link was present in all types of women in the study including those of all races and ethnicities women who were obese and those who were not women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80 as adults get older they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger lacroix saysso they dont need to exercise as much or as intensely to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up we know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result she says its not one size fits all but national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people to get at least 150 minutes of moderatetovigorous physical activity per week and recent analyses compiled from studies in which adults selfreported their levels of physical activity have suggested that older adults have to log moderatetovigorous exercise in order to reduce their risk of early death get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now choose your country united states of america

refutes that research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderatetovigorous guidelines questionnaires used in selfreported studies dont do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day she says which may have skewed previous study results what makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives she says the researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how peopleespecially older onesthink about exercise and their goals for being active i think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who dont believe they can do 150 minutes of hard exercise lacroix says they throw up their hands and think thats not for me

fake,en espaol thursday oct 26 2017 healthday news blood thinners may pull double duty for people with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation new research suggests they help prevent dementia as well as stroke because atrial fibrillation increases the risk for stroke people with the condition are often prescribed blood thinners also known as anticoagulants to prevent blood clots that can cause a stroke atrial fibrillation also increases the risk for dementia during the study more than 26000 of the 440000 participants all with atrial fibrillation were diagnosed with dementia at the time they joined the study about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants such as warfarin eliquis apixaban pradaxa dabigatran savaysa edoxaban or xarelto rivaroxaban the researchers found that people taking anticoagulants were 29 percent less likely to develop dementia than were those who were not taking the blood thinners when the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs they found an even larger reduction 48 percent in the risk for dementia they also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation the lower their risk for dementia along with not taking blood thinners the strongest predictors for dementia were age parkinsons disease and alcohol abuse according to the study published oct 25 in the european heart journal the findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation but proving that would not be possible the swedish researchers said in order to prove this assumption randomized placebocontrolled trials would be needed but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons researchers leif friberg and marten rosenqvist of the karolinska institute in stockholm said in a journal news release it is not possible to give placebo to atrial fibrillation patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur however the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs friberg noted patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate he said in the first year approximately 15 percent stop taking the drugs then approximately 10 percent each year if you know that atrial fibrillation eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment i think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment he said more information the us national heart lung and blood institute has more on atrial fibrillation blood thinners may also protect brains of afib patients

fake,with little fanfare the food and drug administration did something this week that its never done before the agency approved a single prescription drug pembrolizumab marketed by merck as keytruda for treatment of solid tumors in any organ so long as the malignancy bears a specific genetic signature in the fastmoving field of cancer treatment the fdas announcement marks an important milestone close to two decades in the making increasingly cancer will no longer be identified categorized and treated by the organ it inhabits or in which it first gained its foothold in a shift that is already underway cancers will be known by and treated for the common genetic mutations that nurture and sustain them in clinical trial evidence cited by the fda this week pembrolizumab induced complete or partial tumor shrinkage in about 40 of patients with one of 15 endstage malignancies and for 78 of those patients that response lasted six months or more a trial reported earlier this year found that in 17 of 30 advanced cancer patients pembrolizumab stopped or reversed the progression of cancer and 24 patients were still alive a year after starting the drug all of those subjects of course had cancers with the genetic mutation that pembrolizumab is designed to target advertisement in the treatment of patients with metastatic cancers that have failed all other treatments that record of success constitutes a home run said dr bert vogelstein of johns hopkins universitys kimmel cancer center vogelsteins 1993 research laid the groundwork for the discovery of pembrolizumabs broad cancerfighting powers with the fdas announcement drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians patients and government regulators think of cancer no longer will they see all cancers of the lung breast colon brain liver pancreas and prostate as distinct from one another instead they will look for the common genetic mutations that give rise to cancers no matter where theyre found and theyll treat those cancers with a drug that uses that common signature as a homing beacon either for the immune system or for targeted cancer drugs to attack its a key principle of whats called precision medicine the idea that cancer therapies should zero in on a tumors specific molecular fingerprint and not as most chemotherapies do harm healthy cells in the process of attacking malignant ones in the cancers pembrolizumab treats the mutations occur in the complex of genes that govern dna repair deficiencies in the dnas mismatch repair system generate mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells and pembrolizumab trains the immune system to attack those targets the mutations that make pembrolizumab effective had already been found in melanoma nonsmallcell lung cancer head and neck cancer and hodgkins lymphoma and the fda had already approved the drug for those cancers before this week advertisement but this weeks fda approval goes further it makes clear that the drugs molecular targets are also common in colorectal endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers and less frequently present in cancers of the breast prostate bladder and thyroid gland all told scientists believe about 4 of advanced cancers bear the genetic signature that would make them treatable by keytruda the appearance of such a cancer workhorse will bring about profound changes on the cancer landscape not just for patients but for researchers and drug regulators as well organizations representing say people with pancreatic cancer will make common cause with groups that advocate for colorectal cancer patients in cancer centers specialists in say melanoma will start in fact have already started treating patients with a range of other cancers when drug companies and their academic partners set out to test the effectiveness of a prospective cancer drug theyll have to recruit trial subjects using a new and much less obvious criterion than theyve used in the past the genetic signatures their tumors bear even before the fdas announcement this week all these processes were underway the fdas decision recognizes that fact said dr svetomir markovic an immunologist at the mayo clinic in rochester minn who specializes in treating melanoma but the decision also puts cancer physicians as well as insurers who will be called on to pay keytrudas 100000peryear price tag on notice that a new era is at hand said markovic the field of cancer medicine is changing at lightning speed he said physicians are having a hard time keeping up and i can only imagine that people who are regulating it are doing the same he added but this decision by the fda is really wonderful it has made it easier for us to secure treatment for our patients who may have run out of options that may help two other immunotherapy drugs have been approved for cancer treatment nivolumab marketed as opdivo and ipilimumab yervoy but neither has been shown to treat cancers across such a broad spectrum several other immunotherapy drugs are in early trials and could yet prove to be the sort of workhorse that pembrolizumab appears to be advertisement in many ways were at the end of the beginning of immunotherapy theres clear benefit but its still a minority of patients that get longterm benefit said markovic of the mayo institute we will get better at this markovic suggested that the newly recognized powers of pembrolizumab as well as the fdas new openness to cancer drugs that blur traditional distinctions could prompt drug companies physicians and patient groups to take a second look at some abandoned cancer drugs with a clearer idea of which patients they might help and a willingness to design and conduct innovative clinical trials some failures may look more promising he said we just needed to take the first step in showing that this longbelieved theory that the immune system can kill cancer is true markovic added it indeed can melissahealy com immunotherapy drug opens a new era of precision medicine for cancer

fake,army veteran vivian cooke has long struggled with debilitating depression she has tried alternative therapies and medication to cope with her symptoms it wasnt effective some side effects would be headaches or stomachache she told cbs news then three years ago she decided to try something different after hearing about a study testing botox to treat depression while botox is commonly used for cosmetic purposes doctors say the reasoning behind the treatment for depression may not be what you expect we dont believe it has anything to do with looks says researcher dr eric finzi of chevy chase cosmetic center rather he says its because facial expressions are part of the circuit of the brain related to mood fear anger and sadness all go through this muscle finzi told cbs news pointing out the area between the eyebrows where frown lines appear so botox basically inhibits the muscle and calms it down so it becomes more difficult to feel those negative emotions the makers of botox recently announced plans for the final phase of testing it as a treatment for depression finzi notes previous studies show between 50 to 60 percent of patients may benefit from the treatment our hope is eventually it will form a place as one of the tools to treat depression he said botox is a prescription drug that blocks nerve signals to muscles in the injection area its effects are temporary and typically wear off after three months botox is currently fda approved for cosmetic use to lessen frown lines and for medical use to treat a number of conditions including chronic migraines bladder incontinence excessive underarm perspiration and certain types of neck pain and eye issues costs vary widely but the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery said the average price for a botox treatment in 2016 was 376 researchers are also studying whether botox can treat social anxiety and bipolar disorder as for cooke she said she noticed a change in her depression almost immediately i found overall my mood was better on a daytoday basis she said i had less problems with depression even though the study she took part in is now over she said she will continue to get botox injections botox tested to help treat depression and social anxiety
fake,dr maximilian muenke has a superpower he can diagnose disease just by looking at a persons face specifically he can spot certain genetic disorders that make telltale impressions on facial features once youve done it for a certain amount of years you walk into a room and its like oh that child has williams syndrome he said referring to a genetic disorder that can affect a persons cognitive abilities and heart advertisement and thats an incredibly useful skill even as genetic sequencing becomes more widespread for one thing it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place for another people in many parts of the world dont have access to genetic tests at all thats inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing software that analyzes a patients face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes some older attempts at facial analysis relied on large clunky scanners a tool better suited to a lab not the field now in the era of smartphones such efforts have a whole new promise face2gene a program developed by bostonbased startup fdna has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have meanwhile muenke and his colleagues at the nih last month published an important advance the ability to diagnose disease in a noncaucasian face its a promising preliminary sign but if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics systemic blind spots diagnoses vs probabilities the algorithms in general work on the same principles measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns theyre both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients the nih works with partners around the world to collect their photos fdna accepts photos uploaded to face2gene but they differ in a key way whereas the algorithm the nih uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder the face2gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses but probabilities the app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2000 disorders for which face2gene has image data based on the overall look of the face as well as the presence of certain features however the app wont give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of does my patient have a genetic disorder thats intentional face2gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases a means to an end we are not a diagnostic tool and we will never be a diagnostic tool said fdna ceo dekel gelbman drawing that bright line between face2gene and a diagnostic tool allows fdna to stay compliant with fda regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphonebased diagnostic tools diversity needed the algorithm the nih uses developed by scientists at childrens national health system in washington dc seems to work pretty well so far in 129 cases of down syndrome it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time for digeorge syndrome the numbers were even higher it had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases face2gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology since face2gene is a search and reference informational tool the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output gelbman cautioned but theres one big stumbling block for both of them a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades data for nonwhite populations is sorely lacking in every single textbook the ones we had when i trained in germany and the major textbooks here in the us there are photos of individuals of northern european descent muenke said when i told this to my boss he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds and there arent there just arent today there is that resource based on muenke and the nihs work so diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isnt of northern european descent because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder eventually the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds too we have thought about it but havent gone there yet muenke said for example children with down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges as do typically developing african or africanamerican children across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose down syndrome the angles between landmark points on the childs nose and eye according to a paper muenke and marius linguraru at childrens national published with their colleagues earlier this year all of the other typical features werent significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls in fact using a caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice one of the findings that im very interested in in our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others in terms of facial patterns characteristic of digeorge syndrome was the caucasian population linguraru said to continue to fix this problem both the nih and face2gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients faces but thats easier said than done confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today and there are no genetic labs based in africa registered in the nihs genetic testing registry asia and south america are also relatively underserved those numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists most practitioners are located in north america and europe gelbman said nigeria for example doesnt have a single medical geneticist in the entire country its possible that might change with time and effort in addition to his work as a researcher muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the us for a monthlong crash course in medical genetics the program is funded by the nihs fogarty international center president trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 skinny budget proposal announced in march newsletters sign up for morning rounds your daily dose of news in health and medicine please enter a valid email address privacy policy leave this field empty if youre human for now both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set fdna scientists published a paper in january showing that their algorithm could better identify down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces and muenke and linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithms ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds as both groups work on recruiting more researchers they are also working to push their tech forward fdna is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach in theory these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases meanwhile linguraru has his eyes on eventual fda approval for the algorithm the nih has used the ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients facialrecognition software finds new use diagnosing genetic disorders
fake,cnn an aspirin a day may keep the doctor away it may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer according to a study on longterm regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer yin cao an instructor in the medicine clinical and translational epidemiology unit at massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school presented the information monday at the american association for cancer research meeting in washington cao looked at data from over 86000 women who were part of the nurses health study between 1980 and 2012 and over 43000 men who were part of the health professionals followup study from 1986 to 2012 over that 32year period over 8200 women and nearly 4600 men died of cancer the risk of death overall was 7 lower for women and 11 for men who took aspirin regularly compared with those who did not the risk of dying from cancer was 7 lower for women and 15 lower for men who took aspirin regularly compared with those who didnt take a regular dose the strongest connection was with colorectal cancer there was a 31 lower risk for women and 30 for men who were among regular aspirin takers as other studies have showed but it also lowered womens risk of dying from breast cancer by 11 and mens risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23 mens risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality cao said it is good to remember though if a person wants to take a lowdose aspirin especially if a person has had cancer they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first not everyone can take aspirin particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people rulla tamimi the epidemiology chair for the american association for cancer research annual meeting thought the presentation was a beneficial one particularly since scientists are trying to better understand drugs we may all have in our medicine cabinets there has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs tamimi said in an emailed statement this study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death the study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders therefore the findings are believed to be very robust and suggest that aspirin which is widely available cheap and has limited toxicity has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast colon lung and prostate cancer studies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had or are at high risk for a heart attack or stroke and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain even the ancient egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago in april 2016 the us preventive service task force said in a final recommendation statement that taking a regular lowdose aspirin a day may prevent colon cancer and cardiovascular disease for adults between 50 and 69 who have a 10 or greater risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal cancer join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter cao hopes her study will continue to broaden the body of research to include cancerrelated deaths overall next her group hopes to study what specific groups may most benefit from this practice particularly based on those individuals with varying cancer risk lowdose aspirin can reduce risk of death from cancer study says

fake,theres another type of prescription drugs besides opioid painkillers thats involved in thousands of drug overdose deaths in the us every year the drugs are benzodiazepines which are widely known by their brand names xanax and valium and commonly prescribed to help treat anxiety these drugs were involved in nearly 9000 overdose deaths in 2015 according to federal data but theres a catch such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids a new study published in bmj looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids drawing on a huge sample of nearly 320000 patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from 2001 and 2013 researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both the study found that among all opioid users concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose the study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdoserelated emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent if that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2630 opioid painkillerrelated overdose deaths in 2015 keith humphreys a drug policy expert at stanford university and one of the authors of the study said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses making sure patients prescribed to opioids arent also prescribed to benzodiazepines and vice versa even if we didnt change opioid prescribing at all the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just by getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time humphreys said yet the study suggests the opposite has happened from 2001 to 2013 coprescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from 9 percent to 17 percent a nearly 89 percent jump for some patients eliminating these coprescriptions could involve some tough tradeoffs if someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives to avoid a potentially deadly overdose hopefully while keeping in mind that theres no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain so opioids arent the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place there are some caveats to the study for one emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely arent a perfect onetoone proxy for overdoses that didnt involve a trip to a doctor the study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs and since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period its possible the findings dont exactly apply to people with spottier coverage although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results finally since the study looked at correlation not causation its possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users perhaps for whatever reason these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs still its well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each others overdose risk so its not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose or conversely that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose given that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in us history its important and potentially lifesaving for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the studys findings for more on the opioid epidemic read voxs indepth explainer the abridged explainer or the maps and charts explainer researchers just exposed another way to help combat the opioid epidemic

fake,a small study claims children with autism may benefit from fecal transplants which involves introducing donated microbes into people with gastrointestinal disease to rebalance the gut the ohio state university northern arizona university and arizona state university researchers found a parallel between behavioral symptoms of autism and gastrointestinal distress and improvements to both after fecal transplant transplants are working for people with other gastrointestinal problems lead study author ann gregory a microbiology graduate student at the ohio state university said in a news release and with autism gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe so we thought this could be potentially valuable the researchers built off of previous findings that children with autism typically have fewer types of important bacteria in their guts and less bacterial diversity overall the research team surmises the disparity is due to antibiotics prescribed within the first three years of life the study which was published in the journal microbiome included 18 children with autism and moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems the children ranged from 7 to 16 years old a questionnaire was used to assess social skills irritability hyperactivity and communication parents and doctors reported improvements that lasted at least eight weeks after treatment children without autism were used as a control for the study the news release reported on average the score on a scale for ranking gastrointestinal symptoms dropped 82 percent from the beginning to the end of treatment while average developmental age increased by 14 years according to the release researchers also asked the childrens doctors to perform pre and postdiagnostic evaluations which suggested lasting benefits one of the studys limitations is its small size and researchers cautioned that families should not try to replicate the treatment at home we have to be mindful of the placebo effect and we have to take the findings with a grain of salt matthew sullivan an associate professor of microbiology at the ohio state university said in the release but it does give us hope fecal transplants may help children with autism researchers claim
fake,to the ageold question is coffee bad for you researchers are in more agreement than ever that the answer is a resounding no a new study published in the journal nature medicine found that older people with low levels of inflammation which drives many if not most major diseases had something surprising in common they were all caffeine drinkers the more caffeine people consumed the more protected they were against a chronic state of inflammation says study author david furman consulting associate professor at the institute for immunity transplantation and infection at stanford university there was no boundary apparently in the study furman and his colleagues analyzed blood samples from 100 young and old people the older people tended to have more activity in several inflammationrelated genes compared with the younger group no surprise since as people get older inflammation throughout the body tends to rise chronic diseases of aging like diabetes hypertension heart problems cancer joint disorders and alzheimers are all believed to have inflammation in common most of the diseases of aging are not really diseases of aging per se but rather diseases of inflammation furman says the more active these genes were the more likely the person was to have high blood pressure and atherosclerosis whats more even among older people those with lower levels of these factors were more protected against inflammation and they had something else in common too they all drank caffeine regularly people who drank more than five cups of coffee a day showed extremely low levels of activity in the inflammatory gene pathway caffeine inhibits this circuit and turns the inflammatory pathway off the researchers say the goal isnt to make every trace of inflammation disappear the scientists stress in fact inflammation is an important function of the immune system which uses it to fight off infections and remove potentially toxic compounds but with aging the process isnt regulated as well as it is in a younger body clearly in aging something is breaking down and we become less effective at managing this inflammation says mark davis director of the stanford institute but now in this paper we identify a particular pathway that was not associated with inflammation before we are able to point with a much higher resolution picture at aging and the things that should be markers for inflammation the key will be to figure out when the inflammatory response starts to spiral out of control in an upcoming study furman and others will soon investigate the immune systems of 1000 people he hopes to use that information to develop a reference range of immunesystem components to tell people whether their levels are normal or if theyre at higher risk for developing chronic conditions driven by inflammation in the meantime following the example of caffeinedrinking adults with lower levels of inflammation by having a cup of joe or two might be a good idea contact us at editors com is coffee bad how caffeine might slow down aging

fake,and it could be the key to making millions of people healthier writing in the journal science translational medicine on wednesday scientists report that a protein produced by hookworms eases the symptoms of asthma in mice and could one day be made into a pill to treat humans the study is the latest from a surprising field of research into the potentially positive sides of parasites one of the most maligned groups in the animal kingdom it began years ago when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist alex loukas one of the senior authors on the new study the doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease ad ad if you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies where you remove the parasites thats where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies said severine navarro the papers lead author and a senior research fellow in loukass lab at james cook university in australia many parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their hosts immune systems when a hookworm crawls into a human it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it it limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesnt leave its offspring scattered all over its hosts gut instead it thoughtfully plants them in the hosts poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body like a very conscientious cat burglar the hookworm knows its best served by not making a mess its almost symbiotic navarro said because in order for it to survive and thrive it needs its host to be happy and healthy ad ad perhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems thinking that they might be onto something the researchers found 12 adults with celiac disease a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy slithery hookworm it was important that the participants be adults because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children pregnant women and others navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm no matter how debilitating their illness might be parasites are no joke for the dozen trial participants the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten ad ad it was an intriguing result but its difficult to scale that kind of study only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science and because of the risks associated with parasites going around infecting people isnt a viable treatment option so navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit a compound called aip2 and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days the animals asthma systems substantially declined and their airways became measurably less inflamed these benefits persisted for 10 weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment i dont even know how much that is in mouse years navarro said the researchers also noticed that aip2 seemed to have a calming effect on the bodys dendritic cells a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats ad ad it is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory t cells navarro said describing the cells that help modulate the immune system this suggests that aip2 might also help humans since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial which would test the effectiveness of an aip2 pill should that work it has the potential to help the 235 million people around the world who suffer from asthma the compound might also be used to treat other autoimmune disorders like celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis ad this study would also suggest that humans lost something when we rid ourselves of the microbes and parasites that had evolved alongside us for tens of thousands of years theres a major school of thought that says that these parasites should be encountered early in life to contribute to the education of the immune system navarro said ad she wouldnt go so far as to call parasites good deworming campaigns and other public health efforts unquestionably have protected countless people from anemia malnutrition developmental disorders and potentially deadly infections but what we need is to find whats good in them she said and try to restore that missing component read more ad bloodsucking parasitic hookworms could help make millions of people healthier
fake,the genetic legacy each of us inherits is a powerful force and in a few extreme cases it can be deadly still thanks to science genetics need not always be destiny as martha teichner shows us in our cover story amy and brad prices home in omaha nebraska is crazy with all the kids around there are seven of them ages 2 to 11 but if you look closely youll see small memorials to one more liviana who died in 2013 at the age of 5 of a rare nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy mld destroys brain cells and is caused by a single faulty gene she was happy all the time brad said amy added she loved pretty dresses she loved her tutu brad said she was talkative addicted to caillou the animated tv series a lively little girl til she was two her knees were going a little knockkneed amy said and she had been just randomly falling down her doctor said nothing to worry about but she quickly got worse i was in the kitchen doing something and i heard her crying amy recalled and i turned around and said liviana whats wrong and she said mommy my legs dont work liviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010 amy recalled shes sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater and theyre telling me shes gonna die many children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6 and it runs in families if it hadnt been for liviana amy and brad price would never have known to have their other children tested they learned that their infant son giovanni had inherited the faulty gene too i get a call from the doctors office said amy i knew and i was thinking ive just been told two of my kids now are gonna die except thats not what happened doing research online amy price discovered the existence of a medical trial in milan italy of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for mld that would save giovannis life and later when his sister cecilia was born with mld hers too the treatment works only on children who like them have not yet started showing symptoms the price family scraped together the money to go to milan the patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on monday and receive their cells back on friday evening said dr alessandra biffi who oversaw the trial a patients stem cells contain the faulty gene which the doctors have learned how to fix amazing right but then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patients body heres whats really amazing that vehicle is the hiv virus reengineered so the children cant get aids why the hiv virus is it particularly efficient at getting around the body teichner asked yeah its very efficient in entering our cells and thats why we use it dr biffi replied how well did the children do it will take years to know for sure but so far so good at least 7080 of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment dr biffi said some of the children were going to school and having a normal life giovanni price is six now in first grade he and his sister cecilia ceci for short have to go back to milan twice a year to be tested and monitored brad price calls dr biffi our angel she took us in like family so why italy and not the united states gene therapy has a checkered history in the 1990s hyped as the next big thing research withered here after serious setbacks including a death during clinical trials but more than 15 years later its back one sign dr biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at danafarberboston childrens cancer and blood disorders center teichner asked do you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own i think yes absolutely dr biffi replied the mld trial she thinks demonstrates whats possible offering promise to the 30 million americans who suffer from some 7000 rare diseases trials for the experimental treatment ceci and giovanni price received in milan have not begun in the us they are two of only 24 children in the world with mld to receive it compare giovanni to calliope joy carr also six from bala cynwyd pa outside philadelphia she can turn her head a little she can still smile and laugh but thats about all she was diagnosed at 2 for her parents college professors patrick carr and maria kefalis coming to terms with the disease was wrenching its decline in slow motion and thats difficult said carr i remember the social worker said its good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children kefalis said after more than a year of rage and grief kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping mld children it was too late for cal but she was desperate to give her daughters life meaning were not wealthy people she said we didnt know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars and so we said well well start selling cupcakes the calliope joy foundation was formed in 2013 its been slow going but the money added up and when kefalis learned about the italian trial and the fact that amy price had to keep going back to milan with giovanni and ceci it was clear she would use the money to help families get to italy she sent me a picture of giovanni playing in his front yard kefalis said hes three months younger than cal so he shouldve been as sick as cal he should have been on a feeding tube he should be paralyzed and i thought i gotta be a part of this i need to help this happen again and again and again maria kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war her war against mld shes raised more than 250000 and helped where she could but shes hit a wall so far not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the fda the trial in italy is closed to new patients it could be years before any children with mld will be allowed to receive the treatment in the united states now its just impatience kefalis said now its like when do we get this here what will it take tell me what you need me to do until then she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a

fake,even if youre not a big fan of seafood you probably know that adding more fish to your diet can do a lot of good from improving your heart health to lowering inflammation now according to scientists at the university of colorado there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant the study presented at the american society of reproductive medicine annual meeting was in mice so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility but dr malgorzata skaznikwikiel an obstetriciangynecologist who led the study is encouraged she worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids these mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries what she found the mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat meaning they had a larger reserve of eggstobe these could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth when the ovaries were examined even further skaznikwikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup based on this study it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility says skaznikwikiel our study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility exactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isnt clear yet but other studies skaznikwikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function more studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility but for now skaznikwikiel says that there isnt much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats some people who are predisposed to bleeding problems may be at higher risk of hemorrhages with high doses of omega 3s but those cases are relatively rare there may also be other benefits linked to omega 3 fatty acids for the fetus as well in helping nerve development thats why many prenatal vitamins include forms of omega 3 fats we hope in the future to have more answers to be able to say firmly that yes omega 3 fatty acids are the way to go for women hoping to get pregnant she says but even without that firm answer at this point i dont see the harm in supplementing contact us at editors com omega 3 fats may help fertility

fake,artist lorie novak in front of work from her migraine register project which documents all the time shes lost to debilitating migraines it often starts with the aura zigzagging lines come into view everyday light becomes searingly bright and vision starts to slip these are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way its like youre possessed said lorie novak who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood i almost feel separate from my body like its just this painful shell around me thats not me advertisement novak now in her 60s is one of the roughly 35 million americans who suffer from migraines there are few effective treatments and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s but that could soon change a handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines chasing a blockbuster market that wall street analysts say could reach 8 billion a year in worldwide sales the new drugs target a bodily protein called cgrp which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain scientists havent nailed down just how the protein affects migraines but theyre sure about two things cgrp levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away and thus four drug makers amgen amgn eli lilly teva pharmaceuticals and alder biopharmaceuticals have fashioned antibodies that can bind to cgrp molecules and block their activity the goal to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping cgrp in its tracks so far it seems to be working in midstage clinical trials each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants cutting the number of days theyre afflicted by migraines roughly in half its by no means a cure for migraines but it should be enough to merit food and drug administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials according to eric schmidt a securities analyst at cowen and co each treatment is now in latestage development targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who like novak have at least four headache days per month the first therapy could hit the market in 2018 and if everything works out all four could available by the end of the decade so far the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share there will certainly be hypercompetition said william ratner lillys senior director of global headache marketing but the companies fortunes are intertwined he said and the class only wins if headache care in america improves aiming to prevent migraines before they start theres plenty of room for improvement existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy that medication topamax has been dubbed dubbed sleepomax by doctors and patients because its also a heavy sedative im very enthusiastic as i think everyone in the field is about having another treatment option for people with migraines said dr elizabeth loder a professor of neurology at harvard medical school and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at brigham and womens hospital targeting cgrp is not a particularly new idea researchers picked up on the proteins scent more than 30 years ago and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity merck got all the way into latestage trials with an anticgrp tablet spending more than 1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future with the exquisite sensitivity of an antibody however scientists believe they can block cgrp without triggering dangerous side effects alder ceo randy schatzman said because antibodies stay active in the body for weeks the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay mercks failed pill by contrast was meant as an onthespot treatment after the pain started so in some senses its a paradigm shift schatzman said but there are still hurdles to clear only about half of patients seem to respond to cgrp antibodies and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time a genetic test would be the holy grail of personalized medicine said rob lenz amgens global development lead for neuroscience but no one has made one yet and longterm safety remains a major question mark to date none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials but theyve only reported data from 12week studies on about 1500 total patients it will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time loder said i felt like my life was being stolen from me any advance even an incremental one would be a major leap for the field said emily bates who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the university of colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment bates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college like many patients she didnt respond to any of the preventative therapies available the pain is more than anything ive ever experienced and ive run on broken legs before she said i felt like my life was being stolen from me collectively americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine that lost productivity costs society about 13 billion each year according to the migraine research foundation yet scientific progress has been slow in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding bates said its a subjective symptom that predominantly affects women said loder the harvard neurologist thats a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it novak a professor of photography at new york universitys tisch school of the arts spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition but she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called migraine register she takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine some years thats more than 120 pictures the idea in part was to humanize chronic migraines but the project also forced novak to reckon with the toll of the disease something she had tried to ignore for years that for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life novak said of how much time i lose the drug industry might finally have an answer for migraines

health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently sauna bathing leads to a significant increase in heart rate and reduction in total vascular resistance thereby decreasing blood pressure says dr ernst van der wall chief of cardiology at the netherlands leiden university medical centre in a recent editorial appearing in the netherlands heart journal van der wall lays out the research in support of sauna bathing as a safe and salubrious habit for healthy people of all ages he also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart

contrast do not heat the air around you using electromagnetic radiation infrared lamps warm your body directly that may sound freaky or even unsafe but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled as infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas says dr richard beever a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the university of british columbia while theres not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject he says theres evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure congestive heart failure and chronic pain people who spent 15 minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a roomtemperature space one japanese study reported more research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats improve scores on

fake,jessie quinn here with daughter luna williams has been cancerfree for five years thanks to a transplant of stem cells from a babys umbilical cord courtesy of jessie quinn jessie quinn of sacramento was 36 years old when loss of appetite weight loss some eye issues and finally pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room in 2010 tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough she would need a bonemarrow transplant quinn who has a science background knew that finding a donor would be difficult in college she had donated to a bonemarrow registry after learning that people like her with a mixed racial heritage have a much harder time than others finding a match in fact when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her only one name came up her own i didnt know whether to laugh or cry quinn said while searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay what eventually saved her though was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a babys umbilical cord an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types colleen delaney of the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle helped create the cordblood technique courtesy of colleen delaney this therapy and another haploidentical transplantation which uses bonemarrow cells that are only halfmatched to a patient have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years every biological child is a halfmatch for a parent and vice versa many patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy said richard jones director of the bonemarrow transplant program at johns hopkins kimmel cancer center a dangerous process bonemarrow transplants which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a persons immune system the transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow which produces blood cells the procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patients faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor the process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to lifethreatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work in the past a patients body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or nearperfect match a usually fatal development umbilicalcord stem cells however are sort of a blank slate because they havent been exposed to much life such as bacteria and viruses and thus are more easily accepted even if they arent a perfect match when quinns doctors found no match on the donor registry she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients 1 of 26 full screen autoplay close skip ad the case files medical mysteries view photos from a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy heres a look at perplexing medical mystery cases caption from a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating

touched his legs doctors were running out of time read the case cam cottrillfor the washington post buy photo wait 1 second to continue because each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells umbilicalcord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections and if cells from several umbilical cords are used the chances of immunity problems increase this expanded cordblood technique has been a huge home run for patients said colleen delaney of the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle who helped create it no one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person she said the advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixedrace background whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none this is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource delaney said we can find cordblood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor quinn was hospitalized for 30 days and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year she also developed graftversushost disease which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun but she has been free of cancer for five years she remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die it still gives me pause i went to costa rica that i am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking quinn says i was so sure i would never get to do those things again its an indescribable feeling in haploidential transplants rather than wiping out the patients immune system doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it this reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow everybody now has a donor parents are always haploidentical children are always haploidentical jones said siblings are half the time and all seconddegree relatives grandchildren nieces nephews have a 50 percent chance of being a halfmatch everybody now has a donor and that is a major advance yet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bonemarrow transplants jones said despite the recent data showing equivalency of halfmatched and cordblood transplants with conventional matched transplants many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice jones said there are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors and that is unacceptable in the year 2016 jones estimates that about 7500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia but that more than 15000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available gregg gordon 44 developed leukemia in 2011 he noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired he went to his internist who drew blood and within 24 hours gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy his wife caryn recalls how little they knew about his disease acute myeloid leukemia as doctors discussed treatment with them we knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease caryn gordon said he decided he would be focused on being the patient and said do whatever you have to do with me because i want to walk my girls who were then 12 and 16 down the aisle on advice of their hematologist the gordons traveled to hutchinson which has established a national reputation as a bonemarrow transplant center but quickly discovered there was no good donor match we thought we would find a match it was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible caryn recalled according to be the match which operates the national donor program a patients likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent depending on ethnic background but gregg gordon was able to participate in delaneys clinical trial and like quinn received labexpanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation he also will be five years cancerfree in september not everyone is as lucky quinn gordon and 11 other participants in delaneys clinical trial are all alive in remission at a median age of about 47 years the researcher said but two patients died when the disease relapsed a larger trial using umbilical cord blood that had been expanded in a lab is underway read more he beat leukemia so why was he feeling so bad new therapies offer hope for a really bad brain cancer scientists just doubled the number of known contagious

fake,whether you call it water running aqua jogging or hydrotherapy you cant beat a workout in water for an array of health benefits many experts say everyone from pro athletes to stroke survivors are benefitting from aquatic exercise that combines walking or running against the natural resistance of the water to help build strength and endurance running and walking in water is an excellent form of physical therapy for people rehabilitating from hip knee and back injuries and surgeries its also an easyonthe joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill its just an allaround good aerobic conditioner for athletes too sports medicine expert dr naresh rao told cbs news rao is the olympic team usa water polo physician for the 2016 summer games weve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function said rao who is also with the department of family medicine at plainview hospital in plainview new york i personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues hydrotherapy uses a waterfriendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank matt johnson a physical therapist at st lukes hospital in bethlehem pennsylvania told cbs news that the tank is basically a freestanding tub about six feet long by three feet wide with a motorized belt the water height can be adjusted to the patients abilities the buoyancy of the water helps someone whos been injured to walk and run a little sooner than theyd be able to do on dry ground he explained in water we can teach them sooner they can really work on their gait walk without pain do exercises in water that you wouldnt be able to do on land said johnson a physical therapy patient at st lukes in bethlehem pennsylvania participates in water therapy in a hydro track system by conray incorporated physical therapy at st lukes hospital bethlehem pa he uses a hydrotrack underwater treadmill system professional sports teams including the new york yankees and the miami dolphins have used it too the nice thing about it said johnson is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them it works like a lock on a canal he said so even older patients with limited mobility and balance dont have to negotiate getting down into a pool johnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height the treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 03 to 71 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle at waist height its at about 50 percent of body weight at chest height its about 30 percent of body weight johnson said noting for example that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waisthigh water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee taking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer said johnson a recent study in the american journal of physical medicine and rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors researchers asked 21 patients whod had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill they gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldnt go any further walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption vo2max a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise and metabolic equivalents a measure of energy use the study proposes a different very innovative approach to rehabilitation after stroke said dr gisele wolfklein director of geriatric education at northwell health in great neck new york wolfeklein told cbs news she has tried water workouts and said you dont even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up its a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what youre trying to do allowing a cardiorespiratory response wolfeklein told cbs news she noted that medicines veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses michael phelps simone manuel make history in rio budd coates training director at runners world magazine said runners dont just plunge into water therapy when theyre injured its a great conditioning method for healthy athletes too some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are watersafe and can be plunked right in the water an alternative to a water treadmill some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against it creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place said coates for those without access to a water treadmill you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat some pools may loan them out too or coates suggested just try it freeform with waist or chesthigh water to start if you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool look for one that has a slanting beachstyle entry into the water or one with a robotic chair lift ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you if runnings not your thing but the water looks inviting coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater coates said the beauty of water running or even walking is that its great for any age and any level of ability from elderly stroke survivors to olympic athletes galen rupp the 2016 rio olympics mens marathon bronze medalist relies on it as part of his training he and some of the other guys on the nike team its well known they take advantage of the antigravity treadmill and the aqua track coates said the water workout trend health experts are gushing over
fake,photo personal health jane brody on health and aging ever since the large government study called the womens health initiative found a number of risks associated with menopause hormones millions of women who are in or near menopause have been weathering hot flashes and other symptoms on their own but now new research suggests that the benefits of shortterm hormone treatment to control lifedisrupting menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks as long as the treatment is started at or near menopause there are also lots of products now available and different ways to use them that enhance the safety of hormone replacement and there is even an app to help women and their doctors explore various options and choose the most suitable treatment for women without a history of cancer blood clots or heart disease most professional medical societies concerned with womens health now recommend treatment for menopausal symptoms for up to five years using therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone and even longer for those who take estrogen alone every day about 6000 women in the united states more than two million women a year enter menopause at an average age of 51 they stop having their periods because their ovaries no longer produce enough estrogen to stimulate growth of the uterine lining that is shed each menstrual cycle for months before and up to a decade or more after menopause begins many women have symptoms that can seriously diminish the quality of their lives by disrupting their productivity sleep moods and ability to enjoy sexual intercourse the most common symptom hot flashes can leave some women dripping with sweat for minutes at a time several times a day and especially during the night menopauserelated vaginal dryness and atrophy can result in severe sexual discomfort pain and bleeding with exercise vaginal and urinary infections and incontinence until the early 2000s many women with menopausal symptoms took hormone replacement therapy hrt to counter them even some who did not have disturbing symptoms used hrt because observational studies indicated it lowered the risk of cardiovascular diseases and popular books and articles suggested it delayed signs of aging then in 2002 the results of the largest randomized clinical trial of hormone replacement the womens health initiative whi created a kind of menopausal panic prompting millions of middleage women to stop or not start hormone treatments and doctors to not prescribe them the study found that among the women treated with the hormones there was an increased risk of heart attacks strokes blood clots and most frightening of all to many women a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among those randomized to take the leading hrt regimen of conjugated equine estrogens premarin and a synthetic progesterone provera recommended for women who still had a uterus those without a uterus who were randomized to take conjugated estrogens alone had no increase in breast cancer in fact they had a slight decrease over all the hormone combination did protect against hip fractures and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer but for the overwhelming majority of menopausal women the risks of hrt seemed on the surface to outweigh the benefits however according to dr joann e manson an endocrinologist and one of the principal investigators for the whi the whi findings have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted and millions of women for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks are needlessly being denied treatment the pendulum has swung too far she said the whi study actually had nothing to do with menopausal symptoms most of the 27347 women entering the study were already in their 60s and 70s already a decade or more past menopause rather the study was designed to determine whether hrt did in fact reduce the risk of heart disease the leading killer of american women among these older women it found no such effect in the years after the whi findings many new analyses and studies have prompted experts to rethink the wisdom of avoiding hormone replacement especially for women within a few years of menopause whose personal and family history do not place them at high risk of breast cancer experts like dr manson professor of medicine at harvard medical school and brigham womens hospital maintain that the results of the whi study are not relevant to the more common use of hrt for women in their 50s and for those experiencing earlier menopause as a result of medical treatments dr howard n hodis a preventive cardiologist at the university of southern california said the billiondollar whi study made a big mistake by starting the hormones in older women when cardiovascular damage may have already occurred the cardiovascular protection found in observational studies involved women who were younger and within a few years of menopause when they started taking hrt he said in a danish randomized controlled trial of 1006 women entering menopause among those given hormones for 10 years there was a reduction in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer a clear benefit with nominal risk dr hodis said these benefits persisted after 16 years of followup according to the study which was published in 2012 dr hodis is especially disturbed about the reluctance to prescribe estrogens for menopausal women who have had a hysterectomy and dont need progesterone to prevent endometrial cancer in an analysis in 2013 in the american journal of public health dr philip m sarrel and his coauthors calculated that based on reduced death rates among women taking only estrogen in the whi study avoiding hormone replacement resulted in the premature deaths of 18601 to 91610 women in the decade after the studys release dr manson is distressed about the large number of women about a third of those now on hormone replacement who are relying on customcompounded products that have not been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the food and drug administration they come with no warnings in a package insert and could contain contaminants and inconsistent dosages she said theres little or no reason to go the customcompound route she said women today have so many options a wide array of doses from low to traditional and ways to use them in addition to pills there are patches gels and sprays applied to the skin vaginal and urinary symptoms can be treated with vaginal inserts containing very small amounts of estrogen that do not enter the bloodstream and thus are safe for women who have had breast

fake,alzheimers disease the most common form of dementia can be fully cured with an antiinflammatory drug commonly used for period pain a new research by the university of manchester shows currently no drug medications can successfully treat chronic neurodegenerative disease but certain medicines can help alleviate symptoms or slow down the progression researchers who conducted the study on mice found that mefenamic acid a common nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid used to relieve menstrual pain can completely reverse memory loss and brain inflammation that are hallmark changes of alzheimers which currently affects over five million americans for the study researchers used 20 transgenic mice that develop symptoms of alzheimers disease the research was conducted when mice had developed memory problems they were divided in groups of 10 first group was given mefenamic acid dose and the other group was given placebo for one month through a minipump implanted under the skin researchers observed that memory loss was fully reversed to the levels seen in mice without alzheimers there is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes alzheimers disease worse our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid a simple nsaid can target an important inflammatory pathway called the nlrp3 inflammasome which damages brain cells david brough lead author of the study said in a statement brough however cautioned that further research is required to identify its impact on humans and the longterm implications however much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models dont always faithfully replicate the human disease because this drug is already available and the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the drug is known the time for it to reach patients should in theory be shorter than if we were developing completely new drugs brough said researchers said that the lab results identify a class of existing drugs that are likely to treat alzheimers by blocking a particular part of the immune response but they also warned that these drugs are not without side effects and should not be taken for alzheimers disease at this stage studies in people are needed first the research was published in the journal nature communications on thursday period pain drug can cure alzheimers disease new study suggests
fake,researchers out of the university of leicester have developed a new asthma pill for the first time in 20 years which they believe will significantly improve symptoms for those with severe asthma the drug known as fevipiprant qaw039 was shown to reduce asthma symptoms as well as inflammation and it improved lung function and repaired airway linings the pill may be a game changer for future treatment of asthma said professor chris brightling a national institute for health research nihr senior research fellow at the university of leicester in a press release in the study the researchers examined 61 participants who were divided into two groups the first was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks and the second group was given a placebo by measuring the sputum eosinophil the inflammation marker that shows how white blood cells increase during asthma attacks the researchers were able to track the effects of the drug when asthma symptoms occur the number of white blood cells rises and this measurement is used to define how severe the condition is for people with asthma a sputum eosinophil reading will typically be around five percent compared to people without asthma who have readings that are lower than one percent pixabay public domain as the researchers tracked the participants over the course of 12 weeks they found that those taking the drug saw a decrease in their sputum eosinophil reading from an average of 54 percent to 11 percent a unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms lung function using breathing tests sampling of the airway wall and ct scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works said brightling in the press release most treatments might improve some of these features of disease but with fevipiprant improvements were seen with all the types of tests we already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks ultimately the researchers hope that the drug could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks reduce hospital admissions and improve daytoday symptoms making it a game changer for future treatment said brightling source brightling c et al the lancet respiratory medicine 2016 new asthma treatment pill makes huge difference in patients with severe symptoms

fake,ferlistockphoto getty images getting pregnant can be tricky one way an aspiring mother can make it easier is to know when shes most fertile a period spanning a few days every month when her body undergoes hormonal changes and certain bodytracking wristbands may be able to detect these subtle shifts in your biometrics like your heart rate and body temperature depending on the device it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive recently the womens health data startup clue ran an internal test to see if fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant scientists put fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles the devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began according to the berlin company which presented data from the small preliminary study at the european society of human reproduction and embryologys annual meeting this month its a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant the advantage of a passive sensor is these things are done kind of autonomously so you dont need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up clues head of scientific research dr vedrana hgqvist tabor told buzzfeed news its a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant fitbits arent the only wearables that can track fertilityrelated biometrics in the background after a kickstarter campaign yono just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest and ava is working on a smart wristband that aims to help women conceive fitbit how an activity tracker caught an unexpected pregnancy fitness trackers by nature of being worn around the clock have the potential to capture unexpected insights about how your body works and simplify laborious acts like manually figuring out your fertile days that traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest examining your cervical mucus and recording this data every single day on a calendar clues study which ran for 13 months beginning in april 2015 didnt set out to see whether the fitbit chargehr could identify when a woman becomes pregnant rather it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an alreadyknown occurrence how a womans resting heart rate changes when shes experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation for the experiment five women under 40 wore a fitbit chargehr to bed thats because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving the women also logged their periods on clues app and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles a womans fertile window when shes likeliest to get pregnant usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period and lasts for about six or seven days ending on the day of ovulation clue as the researchers had hypothesized the participants fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation as well as during ovulation itself so a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner hgqvist tabor said and the study had one particularly unexpected outcome clues marketing director who was participating was puzzled when her fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute hgqvist tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant and broke the news to the marketing director she was pregnant the happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year when a man posted on reddit about how his wifes fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate upon a redditors suggestion she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant an expert told buzzfeed news at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature another symptom of pregnancy but dont think of this as birth control even though clues marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her fitbit the point of the study was to demonstrate that its possible to use fitbit as a conception tool not as a pregnancy test hgqvist tabor said and thats provided that a couple doesnt have any other fertilityrelated problems manually figuring out your fertile days is a laborious multistep process you have to do every single day however hgqvist tabor said this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method a woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a fitbit so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy if youre curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for clue hasnt revealed that information yet but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later hgqvist tabor says its tricky because it depends on the individual and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute one reason to potentially shy away from trusting fitbits heartrate sensors in a classaction lawsuit some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate regardless clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices ability to capture the daytoday differences in someones resting heart rate which seemed to be consistent and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate you will get a relative change even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap said clue cofounder mike lavigne daniel winklerava your fitbit could help you get pregnant heres how

fake,a cure for alzheimers disease ad a condition marked by progressive debilitating cognitive decline that affects more than 54 million americans is the holy grail in disease research one expert dr dale bredesen a professor at the buck institute for research on aging and a professor at the easton laboratories for neurodegenerative disease research at ucla thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss a hallmark of the disease in a study published in the journal aging bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing agerelated memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration mend a 36point individualized regimen of diet exercise brain stimulation sleep improvements medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months for example an mri of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to mend the hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in alzheimers patients after 10 months of following the prescribed protocol his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile the study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline were able to return to work after adopting mend and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance lives have been dramatically impacted bredesen told cbs news im enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol james e galvin md mph a professor of clinical biomedical science at faus charles e schmidt college of medicine and a professor in the christine e lynn college of nursing who was not involved in the study agreed that personalized approaches such as the mend protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward its important to be excited about this approach he told cbs news however galvin cautioned im not sure about the method the mend protocol outlined in a 2014 study in the journal aging calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with alzheimers such as inflammation stress and diabetes however mend also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require fda approval not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them galvin told cbs news but bredesen believes that the only way to treat alzheimers is to treat all of the underlying problems which may require intervention with supplements nutrition exercise sleep stress reduction these are all critical pieces of this he told cbs news its about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics whatever it takes but even if mend is effective the program is complex and difficult to follow a buck institute press release on the study stated none of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol the significant diet and lifestyle changes and multiple pills required each day were the two most common complaints bredesen said that to simplify the program they are connecting patients with health coaches were trying to make it simpler but we dont want to lose the efficacy he said bredesen noted too that the mend protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of alzheimers one participant from the 2014 study who had been diagnosed with latestage alzheimers did not show improvements with the protocol if you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home i would say that id want to treat you he said its about prevention bredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible galvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported this is moving in the right direction he told cbs news these anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion can memory loss in alzheimers patients be reversed
fake,researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing photo illustration by natalie matthewsramo photos by prudkov and thinkstock its notoriously hard to treat depression in kidsthe antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds new research out of oxford helps confirm this and then some the researchers metaanalysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents the only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine sold in the us under the trade name prozac it outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects prozac is also the only antidepressant approved by the food and drug administration to treat depression in people under 18 thats because the fda has deemed that prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens disrupting brain development dr andrea cipriani psychiatrist and lead author on the study says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily from a clinical point of view we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain he said theres good reason for this researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing back in 2004 researchers at harvard medical school released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals including antidepressants in adolescents the study which used rats in lieu of human children found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain research on how antidepressants actually affect human childrens brain development is extremely hard to come by given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them but other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memorysomething that would be problematic while the brain is still developing and theres another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children they may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior since 2004 the fda has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality especially during the early phases of treatment dr mina fazel child psychiatrist at the oxford university childrens hospital says its complicated because youre giving antidepressants when youre very worried about that young persons mood essentially the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide so far the fda is erring on the side of caution a comment attached to the oxford paper written by dr jon jureidini a child psychiatrist at the womens and childrens hospital in adelaide australia goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids only if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed he writes for antidepressants in adolescents this equation will rarely favor prescribing in younger children almost never to be clear jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents i called him to be sure theyre not better than nothing he said and theres quite clear evidence that theyre more dangerous than nothing he arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice his wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids prozac included is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs dont work well in children because they werent designed for children they were designed for adults and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents the oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 612 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 1318 suffered from major depressive disorder the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression given the us population that works out to more than a million children and adolescents the disease manifests differently in kids whereas adults might report feeling apathetic unmotivated unfocused and just plain sad children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers that means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place of course having an effective intervention once it is recognized would help if theres an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids its that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense anyway guidelines from the psychiatric associations in most countries recommend that doctors first try psychotherapy or talk therapy which is has been shown to work at least by participants own assessment of their depression levels its very hard to test therapy against a placebo for obvious reasons methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns and interpersonal therapy which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships seem to be equally effective in treating depression particularly in adolescents of course this is a highcost intervention in terms of both dollars and time invested and it may not always be readily availablebut the upside is that there is no reason to believe it is harmful like in nearly all areas of science biomedical or otherwise our understanding is limited and further research is required to find out more about both potential treatment options adolescent depression is particularly difficult since gaining consent to study interventions in children is more complicated than it is in adults if we are to answer these big unknowns regarding the safety of antidepressants in young patients critical because therapy and medication are more effective together than in isolation we need more data prozac and antidepressants are less effective in children than previously thought
fake,when it comes to health im skeptical of willpower sure i talk to my students about personal responsibility but when it comes to the health of populations i look for big fixes more than for small acts of will thats why my ears perked up when i heard that two old physician friends had decided to start taking as a preventive measure some of the medications often included in what the field has dubbed the polypill my friends are both top doctors in their 60s with good diet and lifestyle and this is now part of their personal health regimen a polypill might include any of several things a baby aspirin a statin to rebalance cholesterol a drug to control blood pressure and one to lower blood sugar a version less comprehensive than this is available online with a doctors prescription at polypillcom whatever the combination the doses are low so its relatively safe its like a multivitamin but with serious medications some publichealth advocates now argue that everyone over 50 should be on one you read that right everyone if we had perfectly healthy lifestyles these drugs would not be needed but we dont and even if we did the drugs might add further protection one review of the research on polypills comes from melvin lafeber and his colleagues at the university medical center utrecht netherlands writing in current hypertension reports in april they found reason to think that treatment might help higherrisk individuals and urged more clinical trials if moderate and highrisk people benefit the idea of offering treatment to everybody older than 50 years might raise widespread interest they wrote the polypill they concluded could be an important tool to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and make it more likely that patients take the necessary drugs critics worry about medicalizing whole populations predicting that the pill would encourage bad habits and worsen health disparities a fixeddose combination pill is onesizefitsall which doctors dont usually regard as the best medicine but polypills might solve real problems the drugs in them are cheap and target illnesses that afflict many millions around the world and even patients with tailored prescriptions often fail to keep up with the various medicines some of the component drugs are now being evaluated for use with lowerrisk populationsthat is people who dont already have serious problems with their blood pressure blood sugar or cholesterol though not a polypill experiment per se a study published in may in the new england journal of medicine involved 12000 people over five years one group got two drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol the other got placebos in the group taking both drugs 36 died or had health crises in the placebo group 5 did the doses were low so the adverse effects were modest this doesnt mean that we should all be on the polypill but some sensible experts including my two doctor friends are moving toward this sort of preventive approach for people who arent ill or at high risk after all many of us are already taking lowdose aspirin which is possibly the riskiest of these drugs i tend to favor this sort of blunt comprehensive approach to public health much as i like menacing cigarettepackage warnings urging personal responsibility i like cigarette taxes more despite their regressive impact i love drive carefully signs but i like seat belts better and i like air bags best no judgment no decision no defiant will as for driving under the influence breathalyzer tests and taking keys away beat the heck out of admonitions to be sober and find a designated driver human nature is not our ally in maintaining health with heart disease and stroke many millions of lives are at stake and for me it comes down to this will popping a polypill work better than willpower i suspect that the answer may turn out to be yes a polypill may be the next big preventive fix
fake,patients will potentially be able to avoid medications that do not help them and the test could start a new era for personalised treatment of depression scientists have developed a blood test that could identify which people with depression will respond to treatment so that patients can avoid spending months taking antidepressants that do not help them the experts involved believe the breakthrough could lead to depressed patients receiving personalised treatments that are more likely to relieve their symptoms the royal college of psychiatrists said that if it worked the test could prove to be a key moment in the quest for the holy grail of biological psychiatry the scientists at kings college london behind the development claim that their test accurately and reliably predicts whether depressed patients will respond to common antidepressants which could herald a new era of personalised treatment for people with depression if the test proves effective it is hoped that by measuring patients level of blood inflammation it would identify which of them would benefit from receiving antidepressants soon after their diagnosis to stop their condition worsening what does depression feel like trust me you really dont want to know tim lott read more about half of all patients with depression get no benefit from antidepressants the first time they take them and they never work for one in three people currently it is impossible to establish who should or should not be given antidepressants or combinations of them that means that patients are tried on a succession of different drugs for 12 weeks or more and experience prolonged periods of ineffective treatment because their medication does not benefit them one in six britons will suffer depression at some point in their life last year 615m prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in england researchers focused on two independent clinical groups of depressed patients on two biological markers that measure inflammation of the blood as heightened levels are associated with poor response to antidepressants they found that blood test results above certain levels reliably predicted how well patients would respond to commonly prescribed antidepressants their findings have been reported in the international journal of neuropsychopharmacology the identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response is crucial in reducing the social and economic burden of depression and improving quality of life for patients said prof carmine pariante from kcls institute of psychiatry psychology and neuroscience this study provides a clinically suitable approach for personalising antidepressants therapy patients who have blood inflammation above a certain threshold could be directed towards earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies including the addition of other antidepressants or antiinflammatory drugs pariante added dr cosmo hallstrom a spokesman for the royal college of psychiatrists said finding biological markers for depression and other mental illnesses has been the holy grail of biological psychiatry such a finding and a test to back it up would be critical to advancing our understanding of the biological causes of depression it would accelerate our therapeutic interventions and make them more tailored to the needs of the patient but further clinical research is needed to see if the findings can be applied in a clinical setting hallstrom added stephen buckley head of information at the mental health charity mind said we welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems these initial findings are interesting but as with all areas of mental health there is still more research to be done mental health problems including depression are estimated to cost 105bn a year in england the world health organisation has predicted that by 2020 depression will be the second biggest cause of health problems in the world blood test could identify people who will respond to antidepressants

fake,scientists have raised the possibility of using statins drugs used for reducing cholesterol to stop some breast cancer tumours returning the most common form of breast cancer uses oestrogen to grow drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery but about 12000 of the 40000 diagnosed oestrogenreceptor positive erpositive cancers still recur every year study points toward personalised treatment for breast cancer read more early research most of it still in the lab published in the journal breast cancer research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called 25hydroxycholesterol 25hc it can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow dr lesleyann martin at the institute of cancer research in london where the research has been carried out said during the course of treatment erpositive breast cancers that are fed by oestrogen often become resistant to standard hormone therapy our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it this is hugely significant testing the patients tumour for 25hc or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy and tailor their treatment accordingly our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials the research has not yet been tested in humans the scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel in the form of the cholesterol molecule they then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells growth by between 30 and 50 the scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the overactivation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anticancer drugs cholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why erpositive breast cancers recur but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings delyth morgan chief executive at breast cancer now which funded the research said this is a really crucial discovery far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of todays most commonly used treatments this study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard antihormone treatments but this is early research and greater clinical evidence is now needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach another charity breast cancer care said the research was promising but needed further trials this early study raises an interesting question of whether cholesterolreducing treatment such as statins could help lower the chances of breast cancer returning for some women who have developed a resistance to hormone therapy said jane murphy clinical nurse specialist we know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment this discovery may in future help reduce these concerns for some patients by allowing doctors to test if their cancer is likely to return and tailor treatment accordingly statins could be valuable addition to breast cancer treatment
fake,for 67 million american women of childbearing age getting pregnant is not an easy task specialists now have a way to test the parentstobe that may not only increase their chances of getting pregnant but also reduce the risk of them passing on certain genetic diseases when we do preimplantation genetic screening we can ensure that the embryos are chromosomally normal before transferring them back to the intended mothers uterus and that increases the likelihood of implantation dr jared robbins an associated professor in obstetrics and gynecologyreproductive endo infertility at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine told fox news according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc birth defects caused by genetic disorders affect one in every 33 births in the united states the test results may limit the chances of an embryo carrying a chromosomal disorder from being implanted we cant fix the embryos yet but we can determine which embryos are affected by the disease and which arent and only transfer back those that are not affected robbins who is also a fertility doctor at northwestern memorial hospital said a diagnosis before pregnancy may sound like a designer baby but doctors say thats not the case we have the technology and ability to eradicate diseases that have ravaged families for decades dr kaylen silverberg of texas fertility center told fox news theyve lost family members generation after generation after generation or theyve had family members whove suffered from chronic disease thats totally preventable these procedures not only help limit the passing on of diseases they may also help couples get pregnant faster were getting significantly higher pregnancy rates significantly lower miscarriage rates silverberg said these results have helped eliminate preterm birth and hospitalizations for preterm labor and patients and families have better outcomes he added preimplantation genetic screening doesnt necessarily get patients pregnant unless they have good embryos robbins noted all it does is allow us to choose the best embryos to transfer so that we can get the patients pregnant faster he said experts say the couples are not the only people who benefit from these tests the results may help family members who are trying to get pregnant make decisions as well embryo screening helps couples avoid genetic diseases

fake,reviving memory with an electrical current last year in an operating room at the university of toronto a 63yearold woman with alzheimers disease experienced something she hadnt for 55 years a memory of her 8yearold self playing with her siblings on their family farm in scotland the woman is a patient of dr andres lozano a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat alzheimers and other forms of dementia if the approach pans out it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories right now deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat parkinsons disease and tremor for which its approved by the food and drug administration dbs involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes the technique is also approved for obsessivecompulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders including depression chronic pain and as in lozanos work dementia in 2008 lozanos group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus though no bigger than a pea the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control sleep and circadian rhythms it seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger to the researchers surprise following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu he also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends including an old girlfriend with increasing voltages his memories became more vivid including remembering their clothes using a 3dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized lowresolution brain electromagnetic tomography or sloreta lozanos group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings they found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus a key cog in the brains memory circuitry as alzheimers progresses not only does the hypothalamus atrophy but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired that our memories so entwined with our personalities and senses of self might be so vulnerable to a brown out is existentially speaking rather alarming theres something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons and also about retrieving memories by hotwiring the brain yet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing given that alzheimers affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective lozano felt all but obligated to dig further his group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the annals of neurology in 2010 the study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year the fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus explains lozano its easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function as expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate however it appeared that in those with mild disease cognitive decline slowed with stimulation next lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the us and canada all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain in half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away in the other half the stimulation wasnt turned on for a year though they didnt know it preliminary results published in december 2015 in the journal of neurosurgery were mixed but encouraging given that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and dbs of the fornix appear safe no serious longterm neurological side effects were seen in either patient group supporting future research in the field in terms of efficacy however after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups as measured by two scales commonly used to measure alzheimers disease symptoms the adascog and cdrsb alzheimers tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable lozanos final results wont be reported until four years out more intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization glucose is our brains primary fuel the degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity patients with alzheimers typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains as well as again shrinking memory circuits the older patients in lozanos study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brains memory regions not only that the hippocampus of some study patients who received dbs actually increased in size reversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in alzheimers research and lozanos finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that dbs in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus lozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories which he says has occurred in about onethird of his patents requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on yet hes encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe we also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain he says a finding that could mean theres a way to overcome some of the damage from alzheimers evidence supporting dbs in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well a 2012 study published in the new england journal of medicine reported that in seven patients receiving dbs to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex spatial memory improved meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks the entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories a group at the university of cologne in germany is instead focusing on delivering dbs to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of meynert another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to alzheimers last year they published a study in molecular psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to dbs as measured by the adascog like in lozanos study no serious side effects were seen despite the mounting evidence for dbs not everyone is convinced referring to lozanos second clinical study dr nader pouratian a neurosurgeon and dbs researcher at ucla comments the recent deep brain stimulation trial for alzheimers disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease unfortunately the findings suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed however he acknowledges lozanos results suggest that dbs to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients those being older people with less severe disease the most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area he says but i believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial in a 2008 episode of the medical television drama house the shows main character dr gregory house survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky in an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim and inspired by lozanos initial paper house voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation following the procedure the grouchy tv doctors memory returns as is customary on the show he cracks the case dbs for treatment of alzheimers and other dementias is a field in its infancy unlike on tv in all likelihood it wont be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories even though house did this were not doing it yet cautions lozano yet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections albeit random ones and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further were hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition says lozano we want to turn these brain networks back on bret stetka is a writer based in new york and an editorial director at medscape his work has appeared in wired scientific american and on the atlanticcom he graduated from university of virginia school of medicine in 2005 hes also on twitter reviving memory with an electrical current
fake,new york debbie spina is a supervisor for the radiology department at the hospital for joint diseases at the nyu langone medical center in new york city but when cbs news met her this spring she was a patient who was about to undergo sameday hip replacement surgery the 61yearold had been having hip pain for the past two years because of arthritis she had heard a lot of positive feedback from people who had undergone hip replacement surgery at her hospital a big attraction for her was the possibility of going home right after the surgery the option to go home the same day and have that family around me was something that i wanted to do said spina she believed she would be able to recuperate more comfortably at home and get back on her feet faster at most hospitals hip replacement patients can expect a one to threenight hospital stay total hip replacement surgery is increasingly common with more than 300000 procedures done every year in the us the surgery is meant to restore range of motion and help relieve arthritic pain the procedure consists of removing the patients worn out ball and socket joint and inserting an artificial socket on the femur side a stem is inserted into the bone and a ball is on the tip of it nyu langone medical center said it became the first academic medical center in new york city to implement a sameday hip replacement program in 2015 dr roy davidovitch director of nyu langones hip center said he performs around 400 hip replacements a year and approximately 40 percent of those patients will go home the same day davidovitch said patients are happier going home sooner nothing beats the comfort of your own home for recovery and to be quite honest if the pain is controlled and the patient is healthy and medically completely stable there is no reason for them to be in the hospital it really doesnt make sense debbie spina doing prehab at nyu langone medical center cbs news there are two common surgical approaches for a total hip replacement anterior which involves entering surgically through the front of the hip and posterior or entering surgically through the side or buttocks according to research done by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons there are no significant differences between either approach in recovery outcomes six months after surgery davidovitch favors the anterior approach which he believes has a faster and less painful recovery period in the short term because doctors dont have to cut through muscles or tendons to get to the hip like in the posterior approach he does agree that in the long term both procedures have the same outcomes for patients the anterior approach to hip replacement may result in a quicker shortterm recovery but over the long run patients outcomes are the same cbs news but its not the surgical approach alone that allows some of his patients to go home the same day its a combination of what happens before during and after surgery at nyu langone patients have to do whats called prehab before the surgery they work with an occupational and physical therapist to learn information on the procedure learn exercises to do after the surgery and how to properly move around while they are recovering during the surgery davidovitch uses a shortacting spinal anesthetic that lasts about 2 hours and when closing the wound he injects a cocktail of medications to help with the inflammation and pain patients can be up and walking usually within three hours after the surgery but they must have someone around the first night they are spending at home postsurgery the people who are against the whole idea for sameday discharge for hip replacement are concerned about the very rare instances where somebody could develop a blood clot that goes to the lung or a fracture of some sort said davidovitch the rates of blood clots or pulmonary emboli is exceedingly low and in general if a patient is identified as a high risk or a higher risk we dont send them home the same day dr davidovitch and his surgical team performing a hip replacement nyu langone medical center davidovitch makes it clear that this kind of surgery is not onesizefitsall patients are screened first to make sure they dont have risk factors like obesity chronic liver disease or cardiac problems those who have risk factors must plan on staying overnight in the hospital not going right home however not every surgeon is embracing the sameday trend douglas e padgett md chief of the joint replacement service at hospital for special surgery in new york is a lot more conservative about who he believes is the optimal patient for going home the same day the number of patients that are going home at this point in time in our institution is somewhere between one and two percent so its a relatively small percentage of patients that are going directly home said padgett padgett has seen an increase in the number of hip replacement patients and a decrease in their age some are as young as their 40s and 50s he said his department performs the most hip replacements of any institution in the us doing about 5000 a year while he is not against patients going home the same day he cautions that total joint replacement is a major procedure and doctors need to be careful to avoid sending patients home too soon while i recognize there is no place like home should there be the need for urgent or medical care the question is will that be available to the patient when theyre in the setting of their own home padgett said debbie spina met all the requirements to go home the same day her surgery lasted about an hour which is the average time for her type of procedure after the the operation she was able to move around but felt dizzy and nauseous the occupational and physical therapists waited until evening to try and get her to go up and down steps and walk around which patients must be able to do before they are discharged but spina didnt feel well enough so she actually ended up spending the night even though her sameday discharge didnt go as planned spina felt good the following morning and was able to do her exercises and leave the hospital after her recovery is complete she has a few goals shed like to reach i had walked prior to this four miles every morning id like to do that and id like to improve my golf game if possible spina said while smiling davidovitchs goal is for patients to return to their normal level of activity as quickly as possible and with many people wanting to maintain active lifestyles well into their 70s and beyond he expects to see even greater demand for hip replacement surgery and the sameday option in general i see this growing to about 60 percent of my practice he said sameday hip replacements get patients back on their feet

fake,new research suggests that all women turning 40 should get a breast cancer risk assessment since half of them may have risks that are high enough to warrant annual mammograms right away the finding is important because the latest guidelines on mammograms advise that most women can wait until the age of 45 or 50 to start having annual screenings but the review of female patients between the ages of 40 and 44 found that 50 percent had an aboveaverage risk for breast cancer and therefore would be eligible to begin screening mammography at age 40 said lead researcher dr jennifer plichta shes a breast surgery fellow at massachusetts general hospital and brigham and womens hospital in boston how to navigate differing breast cancer screening guidelines the study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods including breast mri and genetic testing plichta said we believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages 40 to 44 in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of 40 and those who would qualify for screening mris and genetic testing plichta said plichta was to present her teams findings thursday at the american society of breast surgeons annual meeting in dallas findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until theyve been published in a peerreviewed journal the analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the american cancer society and the american society of breast surgeons the cancer society updated its guidelines in 2015 recommending that women could wait until age 45 to start receiving annual mammograms previously the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40 the american society of breast surgeons asbs subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation plichta said however she noted the asbs added a few extra conditions women should start mammograms earlier than 45 if they have a calculated lifetime risk greater than 15 percent women with a 20 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer also should undergo screening mris women with a 5 percent or greater risk of a breast cancerrelated genetic mutation should receive genetic testing critical to the development and interpretation of both of these new guidelines is formal risk assessment plichta said furthermore risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography but also who may require screening mris andor genetic testing the us preventive services task force recommendations state that most women begin mammography at age 50 however they also say that women should talk to their doctors about risk factors that could lead them to start breast cancer screening earlier the new study involved more than 900 women none had been diagnosed with breast cancer all were seen as new patients at the massachusetts general hospital breast clinic between march 2011 and october 2015 the researchers said fifty percent of these women met either the acs or the asbs requirements for early mammography plichta said that includes 39 percent who met the acs criteria for aboveaverage risk for breast cancer and an additional 11 percent who met the american society of breast surgeons criteria the researchers also found that 32 percent of the women met the groups eligibility standards for regular screening mris and 25 percent would be eligible for genetic testing plichta said breast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group the researchers noted since the new guidelines lean heavily on knowing breast cancer risk doctors need to redouble their efforts to make sure risk assessments are done for women in their early 40s they concluded many women could benefit from earlier mammograms analysis finds
fake,pregnancy experts including those at the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommend that most pregnant women get 30 minutes of exercise a day if that feels a little onerous consider new findings out of baylor college of medicine in houston suggesting that love of physical activity may start in the womb so maybe women who wont exercise for their own sake will do it for the baby the research in question involved mice not women a team led by robert a waterland an assistant professor of pediatrics nutrition and molecular and human genetics selected female mice that enjoyed running according to a press release enjoyed did they smile half of them were put in cages with running wheels during pregnancy the other half had no wheels the mice with running wheels voluntarily ran an average of more than six miles a night decreasing to about two miles late in pregnancy the offspring of those mothers turned out to be about 50 percent more physically active than those born to mothers that hadnt had the exercise wheel option and that difference persisted into mouse adulthood how does this relate to our own species observational studies of active pregnant women and their babies have reported results consistent with ours waterland said but in the human studies it wasnt always clear whether active mothers who have active children simply raised their kids to exercise a lot or whether there might have been a genetic predisposition to physical activity the baylor scientists were able to correct for those variables our study in a mouse model is important because we can take all those effects out of the equation waterland said i think our results offer a very positive message if expectant mothers know that exercise is not only good for them but also may offer lifelong benefits for their babies i think they will be more motivated to get moving love of physical activity may start in the womb

fake,tenyearold mallory oakes loves to read in fact she has been doing it since before she was 2 years old her mother knew she had a gifted child but those gifts would not come without challenges i think i knew from very early on that she was different but she was my first child so i figured anything that i saw there was a chance that she would grow out of it amy oakes told foxnewscom she would wake up in the middle of the night with night terrors at a very young age she stopped napping around 15 months any type of change in our schedule could set off an epic tantrum oakes didnt know it then but her daughter mallory was one of more than 10 percent of american children living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd she was diagnosed in first grade after there were some difficulties in the classroom amy said but there were other components to it there was oppositional defiant disorder there were some autism spectrumlike behaviors and difficulty later on socializing with other children oppositional defiant disorder is one of the most common conditions linked to adhd in children and is characterized by anger tantrums opposition to authority and sometimes aggressive behavior for mallory the disorder led to a pattern of epic meltdowns which left amy reeling and willing to try anything to control them initially i tried a number of different things different kinds of therapies art therapies i took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch she said we tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us and making matters worse medication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with add and adhd with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms the spectrum of adhd and related disorders is broad and there is no onesizefitsall treatment there were times i remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day it could be five meltdowns a day amy said she couldnt do anything to stop it and i really began to realize that her brain wouldnt let her even if she wanted to be good her brain wasnt allowing her to mallorys oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in hoboken nj to the suburb of glen rock nj in 2014 she wasnt able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an endoftheroad school in my mind it was not a place where she belonged amy said desperate for a solution amy started searching for success stories about kids like mallory who had been helped by different therapies thats when she found the brain balance achievement center in allendale nj we went in for the assessment and her behaviors at the assessment were really terrible amy said i thought we werent going to get accepted to the program and they told us they could help us and we never looked back the specialized learning centers of which there are now 80 throughout the country were developed by dr robert melillo a neurology researcher and author of the book disconnected kids to help balance the brains of kids with learning disorders like mallory what thinking really is is really coordinating different networks in the brain so that we can bring all of those networks together at one time melillo told foxnewscom and if kids have poor coordination in their body they often have poor coordination in their brain poor coordination between their networks so they cant bring all these networks together to learn in the most optimal way the program uses a combination of sensory motor physical exercises and academic learning to help stimulate and strengthen the parts of the brain responsible for certain disorders if you get a child who has really strong left brain and delayed right brain those are kids that may be labeled with attentional problems or behavioral problems or social issues melillo said the easiest way to get their brain to become coordinated is by making their body coordinated so a large part of what were doing is this sensory motor interaction building their muscle tone building their strength building their body spatial awareness the program also incorporates what melillo calls bionutritional guidelines to make sure children are getting the proper nutrition for optimal learning parents are a big part of the learning experience and are tasked with athome exercises to do with their kids mallory attended the brain balance achievement center three times a week after school for three months at a time starting in november 2014 she has since gone on to complete two more cycles of brain balance learning and no longer takes medication to manage her condition shes playing on the basketball team now shes involved in theatre things that she wasnt able to do because her behaviors prohibited her from doing them amy said i really felt very hopeless before we found brain balance so the fact that i just have hopes for her now is a beautiful thing and i think she can do anything she wants to do for more information visit brainbalancecenterscom when medication doesnt work innovative program eases adhd symptoms naturally
fake,michael burk found walking increasingly painful last year crossing the street and tying his shoes became challenges and colleagues noticed he was limping at work on a recent morning mr burk reported to the hospital for joint diseases part of nyu langone medical center in new york city for hipreplacement surgery his surgeon had promised him a better quality of life and said both the operation and recovery would be quick about an hour later mr burk was out of surgery by 4 pm that afternoon he was upstairs in a ward walking on crutches down the hall and going up and down a small model staircase at 6 pm he left the hospital and headed home with his wife to northern new jersey where he had a bowl of chicken soup mr burk 54 years old had what nyu langone calls sameday hipreplacement surgery which practitioners say offers faster recovery times and less postoperative pain with traditional hip surgery patients typically spend days recovering in the hospital and may need additional time in a rehabilitation center hip replacement formally known as total hip arthroplasty is considered one of the most effective surgeries in medicine enabling the vast majority of patients to walk again painfree more than 340000 of the operations are performed in the us a year and include a growing number of patients in their 40s and 50s who want to maintain an active lifestyle michael burk talks with his surgeon roy davidovitch at nyu langones hospital for joint diseases in the morning before his anterior hip replacement photo adam wattnyu langone medical center the procedure replaces an arthritic or damaged hip joint with an artificial joint in the traditional surgical method known as the posterior approach surgeons cut through muscle tendons and tissues in the patients backside to get to the hip joint the arthritic joint is removed and a prosthetic joint akin to a ball and socket is implanted enabling the patient to move with greater ease roy davidovitch who operated on mr burk is one of a growing number of surgeons offering the sameday hipreplacement technique dr davidovitch director of nyu langones hip center uses a socalled anterior approach he makes a fourinch incision in front of the hip close to the groin before going in to install the new joint the procedure is performed through what he calls a natural interval or opening between muscles thereby avoiding cutting through muscle and tendons as with the posterior approach dr davidovitch has performed about 100 sameday hip replacements in the past year there have been no complications and only one hospital readmission for several hours when a patient reacted to the anesthesia he says joel matta an orthopedic surgeon at providence saint johns health center in santa monica calif was an early adopter of the method in the us and has performed more than 4000 anterior hip replacements over the past 20 years dr matta who helped train dr davidovitch designed a special operating table to help surgeons manipulate the patients legs and body to improve access to the surgical site as many as 26 of member surgeons performing hip replacements in the us use the anterior method according to a survey by the american association of hip and knee surgeons the technique is considered harder to master partly because the surgeon has less room to maneuver around the joint than with the posterior approach but some surgical experts say there isnt sufficient data to assert the technique is superior to traditional methods mr burk was walking up a small model staircase by 4 pm that afternoon photo ryan jaslownyu langone medical center jay lieberman president of the american association of hip and knee surgeons says more studies are needed we dont know which is the best approach says dr lieberman who is chairman of orthopedics at the keck school of medicine at the university of southern california in los angeles some doctors question whether it is safe for patients to go home after hip surgery without spending a night being monitored in a hospital we should be careful says vincent pellegrini orthopedics chair at the medical university of south carolina in charleston it is still a big operation some research gives anterior hip replacement procedures a slight edge over the traditional technique is it the cats meow the answer is somewhat says jose rodriguez vice chairman of orthopedics at lenox hill hospital in new york city a part of northwell health who has published studies comparing the different surgical approaches there is less muscle injury and a patients early recovery is definitely better says dr rodriguez who favors the anterior method in his own practice although more patients getting anterior surgery are able to perform physical tasks more quickly those receiving traditional surgery catch up after about six weeks at that point there is no difference in how patients fare dr rodriguez says most patients fully recover from hip replacement after about three to six months regardless of surgical approach doctors say by then the bone has largely grown over the implant and it is safely affixed a special surgical table like this one at nyu langone is used for sameday hip replacement surgery it lets surgeons position the leg so that they can make an incision from the front a socalled anterior approach photo nyu langone anterior hip replacement patients often need less pain medication after surgery practitioners of the technique say although this varies by the individual other surgeons disagree saying pain levels depend on pain management not surgical approach before getting sameday hipreplacement surgery at nyu in january barbara ross of suffern ny was in nearconstant severe pain she says the day after the procedure she took one or two vicodins a narcotic painkiller and since then absolutely nothing she says i am 100 better than i have been in years ms ross 62 is back at work running her public relations firm multiple departments had to be on board when nyu launched its sameday hipreplacement program in 2015 including the chairman of orthopedics joseph zuckerman dr zuckerman says he now wants to expand sameday hip replacement surgery to other approaches and other joints the hospital has spent nearly 200000 over the years on two special operating tables for the surgery dr davidovitch says he needed a shorterlasting anesthesia that would let patients get out of bed and walk the same afternoon mitchell marshall chief of anesthesiology for the hospital for joint diseases says his division was enthusiastic but needed to make sure it could be done safely the outcome a spinal anesthetic that lasts 90 minutes as opposed to the more than threehour anesthesia standard for traditional hip surgery

here two weeks then 10 days seven days suddenly four days two days after hipreplacement surgery keith berend senior partner at joint implant surgeons in new albany ohio prefers the anterior approach it makes perfect sense that cutting no muscles will result in the fastest recovery he says still other partners at the practice use another technique called the lateral approach in which the surgeon approaches the hip joint from the side in all cases patients at the facility go home the same day he says jeffrey leeds 59 years old had sameday hip replacement surgery in november he was back at work

swerve left to avoid a miniature iceberg a red fish flashes at the top of my screen im supposed to tap all the red fish that pop up but not the green fish or the blue and i have to do this without crashing the car an unidentifiable omnipresent gamemeister says doing one thing at a time is easy but doing them both at the same time is where the magic happens as i get better at the game my brain is being trained to ignore distractions and stay focused or at least thats the hypothesis of the neuroscientists who designed it the brain networks that control multitasking overlap with networks that control working memory and attention span so some scientists believe that by playing this game project evo you can improve a range of cognitive skills and by extension relieve a range of symptoms associated with cognitive disorders weve been through eight or nine completed clinical trials in all cognitive disorders adhd autism depression says matt omernick executive creative director at akili the northern california startup thats developing the game omernick worked at lucas arts for years making star wars games where players attack their enemies with light sabers now hes working on project evo its a total switch in mission from dreaming up bestsellers for the commercial market to designing games to treat mental health conditions the qualities of a good video game things that hook you what makes the brain snap engage and go could be a perfect vessel for actually delivering medicine he says in fact the creators believe their game will be so effective it might one day reduce or replace the drugs kids take for adhd but this kind of goal requires a totally different business model before they can deliver their game to players they first have to go through the food and drug administration the fda the first time those three letters were uttered in a group setting everyones like oooo thats scary do we want to do that omernick recalls silicon valley companies routinely avoid government regulation if at all possible the process for fda approval can be slow and expensive if it says fda approval needed in the business plan i myself scream in fear and run away says tim chang managing director at mayfield fund a venture capital firm he has never backed a company that wanted to go through the fda most startups can bring a new video game to market in six months going through the fda approval process for medical devices could take three or four years and cost millions of dollars enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of akili courtesy of akili thats whats been scary about going the regulatory path chang says youre waiting and waiting and waiting for fda approval going through all these different clinical tests and you could run out of money easily before you get through that the worst fear is that the technology will become outdated by the time the fda process is complete tech companies are constantly redesigning their software to keep up with competition and consumer habits chang says in four years a game could be obsolete its really out of sync with the way we think of product iteration he says were more on the order of days and realtime changes where youre pushing out app updates every week on the other hand chang admits that going the regulatory route could really pay off if the fda gives its stamp of approval doctors could prescribe the game and that opens the door for insurance companies to pay for it then youre going into the land of the big big budgets chang says within in the health care field some executives believe the commercial successes of online games like angry birds and candy crush could translate into the medical world they see the potential of these games to not only make money but to save money too when you look at the percentage of individuals that are playing video games 59 percent and overlay that with the percentage of individuals that have chronic conditions or need some assistance from the medical perspective 45 percent the relationship is pretty strong says willis gee director of information technology strategy and innovation at health insurer cigna on one level its about competition the affordable care act has made it a lot easier for people to switch health plans cigna has to find ways to stand out people want to do things that are fun says gee so we have to be there with them it might seem like a strange vision for an industry known best for issuing denial letters but gee believes reimbursing patients to play games could cut other health costs by promoting exercise and preventing disease for example or even reducing the amount of expensive drugs people take as an industry were going to have to reorient ourselves around what it is were really trying to do he says and if at the end of the day the goal is about improving health then we may need to revisit the way we are quantifying outcomes drug companies are keeping an eye on these games too pfizer partnered with the project evo team to see if the game could help improve the diagnosis of alzheimers disease the drug manufacturer believes it could alleviate some of the problems with drug trials helping to make them faster cheaper and more efficient right now screening for alzheimers is subjective patients and families fill out forms on mood and attention the results are often inaccurate some of the people recruited for drug trials end up not having alzheimers at all dr michael ehlers pfizers chief scientific officer for neuroscience says project evo could help them identify better candidates more quickly id like to think we could cut down standard clinical trials in size and length of time by half or more he says in terms of the game replacing drugs someday though ehlers isnt so sure he has a different analogy its just essentially a digital version of otherwise typical kinds of psychological and cognitive behavioral therapy he says but ehlers still thinks game designers should go through the same fda tests and trials as drug manufacturers quite important is that we hold them to the same standard of evidence that they actually work he says here ehlers touches on a broader controversy around games like project evo there are several scientists who say this field is so new that its lacking in good evidence that brain changes actually occur randall engle of the georgia institute of technology believes giving the game fda approval could hinder good science because its a proprietary thing at that point and thats a problem if it becomes proprietary the only people who can do unfettered research on it are the people who own the procedure he says but then again thats exactly how it works with drugs play this video game and call me in the morning
fake,correction an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the person who designed the mmse test this version has been corrected a small company started by a neuroscientist at the university of rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple computerbased tool to help detect early signs of alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia cerebral assessment systems has received marketing approval from the us food and drug administration for cognivue a cognitiveassessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game a patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a timestrapped primarycare physician tends to other patients the 10minute noninvasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brains perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia the federal governments approval to market the device comes as alzheimers researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for alzheimers disease look there is a latelife tsunami of latelife cognitive decline coming at us and healthcare providers are standing on the beach said charles j duffy a neurology professor at the university of rochester medical center who founded the company what we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care more than 5 million americans have alzheimers disease the leading cause of dementia that number is expected to reach 135 million by 2050 according to the alzheimers association with the united states shifting toward an older society the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle in addition to alzheimers a persons mental competency can be hindered by other conditions such as untreated diabetes thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications duffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test peoples memory and ability to think with cognivue patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images such as a group of dots that move around and fluctuate in clarity using a rotaryshaped mouse called a manipulandum the patients try to follow the dots with a wedgeshaped cursor the task becomes more difficult especially for people with early stages of dementia as the dots move around changing their direction speed and intensity all perception is interpretive and so what were doing is measuring that process duffy said other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes cerebral assessment systems device received de novo approval from the fda a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk the pittsford nybased companys fda application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults the subjects ranging in age from 55 to 95 were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities normal mild cognitive impairment and impaired their performance on the cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the st louis university mental status examination slums the device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function it is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven linda m rice a primarycare internist with about 1200 patients in her rochester practice said that after a year of using the device in her clinic she is convinced of its worth about half of her patients are older than 65 and

fake,previous research on communication in couples affected by alzheimers has tended to focus on deficits said study author christine williams professor and director of the phd in nursing program at florida atlantic universitys christine e lynn college of nursing identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage as alzheimers disease progresses cognitive impairment can take an ever greater toll on communication and relationships a new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by alzheimers maintain a sense of connection which could improve quality of life for both partners advertisement no one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right what is helping said williams whose findings were published in the international journal for human caring some past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse with alzheimers can follow a relationship is obviously so much more than that members of williamss research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks the couples who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses were receiving coaching in communication with caregivers learning to listen to avoid arguing to not treat their spouse like a child twice during the 10 weeks the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room a total of thirty 10minute conversations were recorded in analyzing the recordings williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection these patterns showed the caregivers applying what theyd learned through coaching in creative ways she said they included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in daytoday events waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words and finding alternate ways to communicate for example singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed advertisement the caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations they were willing to listen to stories they had heard before and resisted correcting their partners versions of past events this showed that they value the relationship more than being right williams said some of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations the paper noted yet williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by alzheimers previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers and most say they need education about communication the reality is a person with dementia isnt going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten williams said at the same time people with alzheimers do have moments of clarity or show affection when its unexpected these are moments that caregivers can cherish ami albernaz can be reached at amialbernaz com better communication can help couples affected by alzheimers

fake,by dennis thompson healthday reporter monday july 6 2015 healthday news a scan of calcium deposits inside your arteries can help doctors deduce how long youre likely to live a new study has found the test called a coronary calcium scan uses a regular ct scan to look for calcium deposits in the three major arteries that carry blood away from the heart said lead author leslee shaw a professor of cardiology at emory university in atlanta people with the largest amounts of calcium in their arteries carry an early death risk thats six times greater than those with no calcium deposits researchers found in a 15year study of nearly 10000 patients if you had no calcium or very small amounts we were able to track over a very long time that you actually had a very outstanding survival shaw said calcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls shaw said these plaques which are caused by blood cholesterol build up over time and cause arteries to narrow leading to heart disease as the heart works harder to pump blood through the body if a plaque bursts a blood clot can form on its surface blocking blood flow and causing a heart attack according to the us national institutes of health if the clot breaks free it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke to prevent plaques from bursting the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them shaw said doctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on ct scans and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries shaw said up to now however theres been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a persons longterm health risk the study authors said in background information most studies involving these scans have a followup of five years or less in this new study doctors referred 9715 healthy patients in the nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the militarys tricare healthcare system the patients underwent a calcium scan and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors researchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years taking special note of the 936 patients who died analysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a persons major arteries patients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death compared to those with no calcium deposits at all but people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium this is not a new test but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors said dr william zoghbi past president of the american college of cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for houston methodist hospital calcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems zoghbi said this study confirms their usefulness in that regard he said calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms he said the best use is in patients who have no symptoms but the value of the test is not well known the results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves shaw said it can be a very potent motivator she said people with many calcium deposits can improve their longterm prospects by eating right exercising and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes shaw said shaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a persons regular physical exam as common as blood cholesterol tests they generally cost less than 100 she said i think its headed that way she said were kind of on the edge of this becoming more accepted the findings appear in the july 7 issue of annals of internal medicine more information for more on coronary calcium scans visit the us national institutes of health calcium scan can predict premature death risk study says

fake,in 2012 i was shocked to learn that new guidelines issued by the the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists stated that women should wait three to five years between pap smears which are the primary method of screening for cervical cancer thanks to that recommendation which has influenced insurance company policies annual pap tests are no longer the standard of care today and i see that as a huge problem for one the three to fiveyear interval between screening tests for women ages 21 to 65 doesnt take into account the several risk factors that boost a womans chance of developing cervical cancer such as multiple sexual partners a weakened immune system that occurs with smoking and even oral contraceptive use for more than five years for these women there is a still a serious need for more frequent cervical cancer screening but nowhere in the guidelines are these risk factors addressed unfortunately the only risk factor that changes the recommended frequency of screening is an abnormal pap result in the past advertisement advertisement i watched a 28yearold woman die of cervical cancer during my obgyn residency and it was horrible i dont see why major medical organizations have made a recommendation that puts women at risk of a cancer that can be so easily prevented and frankly i see it as more of an economic decision than anything else lets take a closer look at what this means lets say you have multiple sexual partners and during a visit to your gynecologist this information flies under the radar for whatever reason a woman with multiple sexual partners has a greater chance of acquiring hpv the virus that causes most cervical cancers by the same token no one brings up the issue of your partners number of partners and by the way you can never be 100 percent positive that your partner is monogamous no one can the greater the number of partners he has the greater his risk of contracting hpv and passing it to you so you arent given cervical cancer screening that day when in fact many doctors would agree that you need it another problem i have with the current guidelines is this new recommendations published last summer in the annals of internal medicine advised physicians to stop offering routine pelvic exams to asymptomatic averagerisk women i find this outrageous pelvic exams allow your physician to inspect the vulva for changes and even feel around the ovaries uterus and fallopian tubes for any masses the delay to diagnosis of vulvar cancer specifically is about 18 months a gynecologist is trained to detect early changes and then do a biopsy for anything suspicious as a diagnostic and screening tool the pelvic exam is vital what makes all of this even worse no more pelvic exams and infrequent paps mean women wont see their gynecologist as regularly and they may miss opportunities to voice concerns related to their reproductive health an annual wellwoman visit with your gynecologist allows you to discuss your health status sexual practices contraception needs and get a breast exam among other things so its still important for you to go even if you dont end up having a pap or pelvic exam ultimately when it comes to gynecological cancer screening tests every woman has individual risk factors so you should talk to your doctor about yours if you fall into any of the high risk categories you have multiple partners you smoke or are otherwise immunocompromised and youve been on birth control pills for five years or more you really should be screened at least every other year if youre insurance denies to cover this you should fight them on the basis of being at a higher risk and always be sure to visit your gyno if youre having any sort of symptom such as pelvic pain irregular discharge or sexual dysfunction all of which can point to a more serious problem in these cases you should be given a pelvic exam at the very least dr jennifer landa is chief medical officer of bodylogicmd the nations largest franchise of physicians specializing in bioidentical hormone therapy dr jen spent 10 years as a traditional obgyn and then became boardcertified in regenerative medicine with an emphasis on bioidentical hormones preventative medicine and nutrition she is the author of the sex drive solution for women learn more about her programs at wwwjenlandamdcom the real importance of getting a pap smear and pelvic exam

fake,the mind diet 10 foods that fight alzheimers and 5 to avoid istockphoto doctors have been saying for years that what you eat can affect the health of your heart now theres growing evidence that the same is true for your brain a new study by researchers at rush university medical center in chicago shows a diet plan they developed appropriately called the mind diet may reduce the risk of developing alzheimers disease by as much as 53 percent even those who didnt stick to the diet perfectly but followed it moderately well reduced their risk of alzheimers by about a third diet appears to be just one of many factors that play into who gets the disease said nutritional epidemiologist martha clare morris phd the lead author of the mind diet study genetics and other factors like smoking exercise and education also play a role but the mind diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against alzheimers regardless of other risk factors the study published in the journal alzheimers dementia looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing it found participants whose diets most closely followed the mind recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 75 years younger the mind diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 brain healthy food groups a person should eat and five unhealthy food groups to avoid it combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health the mediterranean diet and the dash dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet mind stands for mediterraneandash intervention for neurodegenerative delay but the mind diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of alzheimers click through to see which foods to eat and which ones to avoid for optimal brain health green leafy vegetables istockphoto the mind diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables kale spinach broccoli collards and other greens are packed with vitamins a and c and other nutrients at least two servings a week can help and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits the mediterranean and dash diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables but the mind diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of alzheimers other vegetables istockphoto like other diets focused on weight loss and heart health the mind diet emphasizes the importance of vegetables for brain health the researchers recommend eating a salad and at least one other vegetable every day to reduce the risk of alzheimers nuts istockphoto nuts are a good snack for brain health according to the mind diet study nuts contain healthy fats fiber and antioxidants and other studies have found they can help lower bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease the mind diet recommends eating nuts at least five times a week berries istockphoto berries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the mind diet blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain morris said she noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function the mind diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week beans istockphoto if beans arent a regular part of your diet they should be high in fiber and protein and low in calories and fat they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the mind diet the researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of alzheimers whole grains tom perkins whole grains are a key component of the mind diet it recommends at least three servings a day fish istockphoto the mind diet study found eating fish at least once a week helps protect brain function however theres no need to go overboard unlike the mediterranean diet which recommends eating fish almost every day the mind diet says once a week is enough poultry shaiith poultry is another part of a brainhealthy eating plan according to the mind diet it recommends two or more servings a week olive oil istockphoto olive oil beat out other forms of cooking oil and fats in the mind diet the researchers found people who used olive oil as their primary oil at home saw greater protection against cognitive decline wine istockphoto raise a toast to the mind diet it recommends a glass of wine every day just one though wine rounds out the list of of 10 brain healthy food groups that help protect against alzheimers green leafy vegetables other vegetables nuts berries beans whole grains fish poultry olive oil and wine now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your risk of developing dementia red meat juniart red meat isnt banned in the mind diet but the researchers say you should limit consumption to no more than four servings a week to help protect brain health thats more generous than the mediterranean diet which restricts red meat to just one serving a week butter and stick margarine istockphoto butter and stick margarine should be limited to less than a tablespoon per day on the mind diet brainhealthy olive oil can often be used instead cheese istockphoto cheese may be delicious but it doesnt do your brain any favors according to the mind diet study eat cheese no more than once a week if you want to reduce your risk of alzheimers

fake,cnn by the time cynthia falardeau read about alex pring a little boy who got a batterypowered robotic arm last summer she had made peace with her son wyatts limb difference her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands at a week old doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand they were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die falardeau mourned her boys missing arm for years but in time embraced her son as he was wyatt also learned to adapt they tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months his main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store falardeau wrote on cnn ireport in truth she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autismrelated delays the limb difference was secondary so when a friend shared a story from the today show with wyatt in mind about a team of university of central florida ucf students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6yearold pring using a threedimensional printer on campus falardeau was defensive he doesnt need this she thought her fifthgrader had a different reaction i want one of these robot arms falardeau remembers wyatt telling her and her husband i could ride a bike i might even be able to paddle a kayak there were other things the 12yearold boy said he would do if he had two hands a proper somersault clap with two hands dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading stuff she hadnt really thought about but he clearly had falardeau got in touch with the orlando students through enable an online volunteer organization started by rochester institute of technology research scientist jon schull to match people who have 3d printers with children in need of hands and arms the organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at enablingthefutureorg that can be assembled for as little as 20 to 50 middle and high school student groups and girl and boy scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free the ucf team which operates a nonprofit called limbitless solutions is special because its the only group in the 3d volunteer network making electronic arms most 3d arms are mechanical which presents a challenge for children without elbows with mechanical arms the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow the students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep its really just a stepbystep process of solving problems the first problem we solved was how do we make the hand move electronically and then how do we attach this arm to a child said sophomore tyler petresky its just one problem after another we keep solving thats what engineering is all about the centers for disease control and prevention estimates about 1500 babies in the united states are born with upper limb deformities each year comprehensive statistics arent available for the number of children with amputations such as wyatt the ucf project started when albert manero an engineering doctoral student heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3d printed hand he got involved with enable and met alex a local boy teased because of his missing arm and set about designing a robotic replacement they gave it to alex for free my mother taught us that were supposed to help change the world manero said at the time were supposed to help make it better the students were blown away by what happened after that the today show and other national news outlets featured stories about alex and manero and then they got international attention families in more than 25 countries have asked the ucf students to help their children in february microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble the students use the printer in the schools manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials about 350 through donations petresky got involved with the design of prings hand because manero knew he was good with electronics he bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches i went over to his house and helped him out with electronics he said i found out he was working on an arm and i thought that was the coolest thing in the world eventually manero moved to germany for a fulbright scholarship and left petresky in charge of running the operations in orlando petresky says they ask every family about the childs favorite color superhero and interests so the new limb can not just be a piece of plastic but be a part of them as theyve designed the bionics theyve learned that kids dont necessarily want to blend in children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes disneys frozen and in wyatts case the blueskinned men from blue man group for christmas the group upgraded alexs plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling optimus prime from transformers we quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal and much more about expressing yourself petresky said theres a large aspect of being artistic and being creative the team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including wyatt he traveled with his mom to ucf last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close he expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month his mom cynthia was most excited about seeing wyatt being celebrated for who he is the adoration of college students was an affirmation that money cant buy he was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself she wrote in her ireport wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other

fake,colorectal cancers kill more americans than any other cancer except lung cancer but a new study suggests you can reduce your risk of the disease by laying off the cheeseburgers and pastramis and opting for a large salad or broiled salmon instead after tracking 77659 americans and canadians for an average of more than seven years researchers from loma linda university found that vegetarians were 22 less likely than meateaters to be diagnosed with colon cancer or rectal cancer the results were published monday by jama internal medicine the study volunteers were all members of the seventh day adventist church which strongly encourages a vegetarian diet the church also urges followers to exercise regularly and refrain from smoking drinking or using mindaltering substances as a result the researchers didnt just compare vegetarians to nonvegetarians they were also able to assess the relative merits of different types of vegetarian diets heres how they stacked up advertisement by far the lowest incidence of colorectal cancers was seen in pescovegetarians people who eat fish at least once a month but eschew all other types of meat compared to omnivores pescovegetarians were 43 less likely to be diagnosed with these cancers during the course of the study lactoovo vegetarians who eat eggs and dairy foods but not fish or other meats came in second with an 18 reduced incidence of colorectal cancer they were followed closely by vegans who dont eat eggs dairy products or any kind of meat who were 16 less likely to get a colorectal cancer diagnosis even semivegetarians who ate meat at least once per month but no more than once per week were 8 less likely to get colorectal cancer during the study period than nevervegetarians the researchers found all of these riskreduction calculations were adjusted to account for age gender race education level daily calorie intake exercise habits smoking and drinking behavior family history of colorectal cancer and other medical conditions advertisement the researchers also crunched the numbers separately for colon cancer and rectal cancer in this analysis being a vegetarian of any type reduced the risk of colon cancer more than rectal cancer previous studies have found that eating red meat especially processed meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and eating fiber is known to reduce the risk so its not exactly surprising that vegetarians fared better than meateaters in this study but some of the details remain mysterious for instance the vegetarians in this study ate fewer foods with refined grains added fats and sugar than their nonvegetarian counterparts the study authors even said it will take more research to determine whether the pescovegetarians were better off because they ate fish for more medical news follow me on twitter and like los angeles times science health on facebook vegetarians who ate fish had lowest colorectal cancer risk study says
fake,going for a jog on a treadmill can predict how long youre going to live a large new study suggests researchers from johns hopkins medicine looked at standard treadmill stress test results for more than 58000 subjects ages 18 to 96 after age and sex the two best predictors of whether the patient would be alive in ten years was how highly activated their metabolism was and how fast their heart would beat during the test metabolism was calculated using metabolic equivalent of tasks or mets a measure of how much energy someone expends during a task the higher met level achieved the more likely it was the subject would last another decade the closer someone came to reaching their maximum heart rate as they ran the less likely they were to die within ten years compared to someone who only reached about 85 percent of their maximum heart rate during the test maximum heart rate was determined by subtracting the subjects age from 220 a formula thats been used for decades by exercisers and doctors alike dr jennifer ashton abc news medical contributor explained the science behind the test on good morning america in medicine we usually base predictions of survival on the absence or presence of a disease state she said whats new here is that there is now a fancy equation doctors can use to compare the chances of survival for one 50yearold woman against another 50yearold woman rather than being viewed as morbid experts should be able to use this information to motivate people to change their behavior ashton said everyone can improve their survival score by exercising more often and pushing it a little harder when they do she added this is in your power to change and improve your numbers you can actually change your own destiny she said how a new treadmill test predicts survival of the fittest

fake,staying sexually activeand considering sexuality an important part of lifemay be linked to higher cognitive functioning as people age according to a study in the march issue of the american journal of geriatric psychiatry older men and women who were satisfied with their sexual relationships and considered sexuality an essential component of aging performed better on tests of cognitive function than those who felt sexuality and intimacy were unimportant the research showed previous studies have focused on the prevalence of sexual activity in older people but the influence of cognitive decline on how sexuality is perceived in later life wasnt known researchers said the study conducted in the netherlands involved 1747 men and women from a larger study of aging the subjects were 71 years old on average about threequarters had partners researchers assessed cognitive function with tests of memory mental processing speed general cognitive function and fluid intelligence or the ability to reason and think abstractly subjects responded to four questions about the importance of sexuality personally and to older people generally and about their current sex life and need for intimacy and touching with aging chronic diseases depression and medications were recorded a quarter of the subjects rated their current or personal sexuality as important or very important while 41 rated it as unimportant nearly 28 agreed that sexuality at an older age isnt important anymore 42 felt it was important current sexual activity was considered pleasant and unpleasant by 32 and 6 respectively but 67 believed intimacy and touching are still needed in older people while 12 didnt agree subjects who didnt see the importance of sexual behavior or a need for intimacy and who considered their current sexuality unimportant and their sex life unpleasant had lower average cognitive scores compared with those who felt sexuality was important and were satisfied with their current sexual activity the association between lower cognitive functioning and the belief that sexuality was unimportant was significant in both sexes but seemed stronger in women researchers said caveat the study didnt include subjects with severe cognitive impairment causal relation between sexuality and cognitive function couldnt be determined the perception of sexuality in older adults and its relationship with cognitive functioning running injuries regular shoe changesand playing different sportsmay reduce the risk of injury in recreational runners suggests a study in the current issue of the scandinavian journal of medicine science in sports running involves the repetition of a large number of almost identical movements with very few variations which can lead to overuse injuries researchers said alternating shoes and sports may help to vary the musculoskeletal load the study suggests in 2012 researchers in luxembourg recruited 264 recreational runners 69 women and 195 men in their early 40s for the 22week study more than half 56 alternated approximately four pairs of running shoes of different makes or models on average while 44 mostly wore the same pair the subjects used an electronic database to record their weekly running and other sports activities including the type of activity duration intensity distance and shoe use pain in the lower back or legs that developed during exercise and prevented normal activity was recorded along with the day the sport was resumed a third of participants reported at least one runningrelated injury during the study most of the injuries affected muscles and tendons and 36 lasted up to a month or longer runners who wore more than one pair of shoes had a 39 lower risk of injury than those who wore the same pair during almost all running sessions the adjusted results showed multiple shoe users wore the main pair 58 of the time during the study period while other runners wore the same shoes 91 of the time runners with multiple shoes participated in other sports for close to two hours a week about twice the amount of time spent by singleshoe runners and were more regular in their training and experienced in competitions caveat the study was relatively short which may have limited the number of reported injuries researchers said can parallel use of different running shoes decrease runningrelated injury risk response shift people treated for chronic hand eczema may take a rosier view of the disease after it improves playing down the severity of their worst outbreak a study found this change in perception called a response shift could adversely affect the behaviors patients use to manage the disease according to a report in the march issue of contact dermatitis a response shift is particularly important in clinical studies as it may result in flawed reporting of treatment effects the study said taking regular photographs of skin areas affected by eczema could help counteract a response shift by patients researchers suggest eczema affects an estimated 102 of us adults according to the national eczema association a nonprofit research organization hand eczema is a fluctuating disease that has been shown to seriously affect patients quality of life the study said researchers in denmark recruited 224 patients with hand eczema 145 women and 79 men ages 18 to 70 quality of life and eczema severity were assessed with two questionnaires six months apart subjects rated the severity of their current eczema and their worst outbreak on a scale from 0 none to 10 extremely bad at both time points close to twothirds 612 rated their current eczema lower on the second assessment at 35 on average compared with 47 on the first assessment indicating an improvement researchers said eczema was unchanged or worse in 388 but 491 of subjects rated their worstever eczema outbreak at 8 on average at the second assessment and 85 on the first a statistically significant change that indicated a response shift researchers said caveat the sixmonth followup period was relatively short researchers said response shift in severity assessment of hand eczema with visual analogue scales

fake,en espaol by alan mozes healthday reporter sunday march 1 2015 healthday news a procedure that delivers the anesthetic lidocaine xylocaine directly to nerves in the back of the nasal cavity appears to offer significant relief to migraine sufferers preliminary research indicates early findings suggest that a single outpatient treatment can reduce migraine pain levels by about 35 percent for up to a month after the procedure according to this small ongoing study the technique is a minimally invasive treatment option said the studys lead author dr kenneth mandato a vascular and interventional radiologist at albany medical center in albany ny he added that he views the new procedure as a clear simple alternative to standard migraine treatments this nasal spray option is safe convenient and innovative said mandato in the new study his team focused on 112 patients averaging about 45 years of age all had been diagnosed with either migraines or another type of intensely painful and cyclically occurring headache known as cluster headaches before participating in the study patients were asked to indicate their pain levels according to a standardized scale from 1 to 10 pretreatment pain scores averaged more than 8 mandato said the participants all underwent a session of imageguided therapy in which a spaghettisized catheter was inserted through a nostril and into the nasal passage to deliver a dose of lidocaine to a nerve center known as the sphenopalatine ganglion this was then repeated in the opposite nostril according to the researchers mandato stressed that no one in the study required sedation to undergo the procedure the target nerve bundle explained mandato resembles a complex highway crossing with many nerve signals and exits going in all directions and he said the hope was that lidocaine would essentially shortcircuit that bundles headachecausing pathway the day after the procedure average migraine pain levels had dropped from about 8 to just over 4 pain scores rose only marginally a week after the procedure and reached an average of just over 5 by the one month postprocedure mark according to the study the procedure didnt help everyone though seven of the patients about 6 percent failed to get any benefit from the treatment the investigators found however 88 percent of those in the study reported needing less standard pain relief medication after the procedure the researchers acknowledged that this procedure is a temporary solution that would need to be repeated mandato said his team is continuing to monitor patients to see how well the nasal spray approach holds up six months out dr richard lipton director of the montefiore headache center in new york city described the findings as very dramatic unmet treatment needs in chronic migraine are huge as is the overuse of medications he noted when a body gets used to having a chronic headache suppressor the patient can experience a rebound in the absence of that suppressor so developing an effective treatment that can reduce the need for acute medicine would be very valuable lipton explained these results sound very promising lipton added of course it remains to be seen if the demonstrated benefit already seen holds up over a longer period of time and with a bigger group of patients mandato and colleagues are scheduled to present their findings sunday at the society of interventional radiology annual meeting in atlanta findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until theyve been published in a peerreviewed journal the study received no funding from private industry more information theres more on migraine treatment at the us national institute of neurological disorders and stroke nerve treatment via nose shows promise against migraines
fake,surgeons sometimes fly blind when operating on hardtoreach anatomical parts or hardtosee conditions for visual references inside the brain or body they often rely on images and scans taken before an operation a growing number of hospitals are equipping operating suites with magnetic resonance imaging ct scanners and other technology that enables surgeons to scan a patient in real time without having to move them from the operating table the resulting realtime 3d visualsknown as intraoperative imaginghelp surgeons excise tumors and tissue with greater accuracy reducing risks such as nicked nerves from an errant knife and the potential need for repeat surgery the images also help surgeons spot bleeding blood clots or other unexpected complications outside their field of vision intraoperative imaging allows surgeons to perform significantly better than conventional surgery says sohail mirza medical director of the center for surgical innovation and chairman of orthopedics at the dartmouthhitchcock health system in lebanon nh affiliated with dartmouth colleges medical school we still need a surgeons training and judgment dr mirza says but we can use threedimensional deep imaging to get past the limitations of human error and handeye coordination dartmouthhitchcock opened the 20 million center last year with financing from a national institutes of health grant and its own funds mri and ct scanners mounted on ceiling rails slide in and out of four sterile operating and procedure rooms the technology first developed for use in complex brain surgeries now is expanding for use in spinal cord surgery biopsies and removal of tumors and lesions in the breast lung prostate liver pancreas and kidneys researchers are studying other ways the technology can help diagnose and treat cancer and other diseases doctors used realtime mri and ct scan images to remove a complicated tumor last year from the spine of jack deliso 9 center with him are his parents lisa and michael and sisters chloe left and rigney photo michael deliso the realtime scans can show surgeons whether tissue or organs have shifted during an operation and where the border of a lesion ends and healthy tissue begins in radiation treatment doctors using the scans can see when a tumor shifts and pause to spare healthy tissue the images can also provide better visualization of masses that are completely out of sight studies have found that in 40 of cases brain surgeons will modify what they are doing based on an intraoperative mri scan this is precision medicine at its best using an individual patients images to guide their procedure says clare tempany codirector of the advanced multimodality imageguided operating suite program known as amigo at brigham and womens hospital in boston the program is part of the hospitals federallyfunded national center for imageguided therapy which is researching the use of intraoperative imaging in a variety of procedures and treatments including its costeffectiveness since amigo opened in 2011 700 patients have undergone surgery including lung biopsies and breastconserving tumor removal the need for more accuracy is real as many as 40 of women who have breastconserving surgery known as lumpectomy followed by radiation need a second operation because positive cells remain at brigham and womens researchers are looking at how to improve surgeons ability to determine the exact margins of tumors using intraoperative mri followed by chemical analysis to decrease the need for reoperations dr mirza says in the past during spine surgeries if he became concerned about whether screws or implants were perfectly placed he would close up an incision and wheel his patient two floors down for a scan in some cases he would bring the patient back to revise the surgery or in other cases accept slightly imperfect results to avoid more cutting revisions in addition to adding to the patients risks use up costly operating room and staff time he says last fall jack deliso then 8 needed surgery to remove a painful mass wrapped around his lower spine that made it increasingly hard for him to walk an initial biopsy to test for malignancy had been inconclusive dr mirza and a pediatric neurosurgeon david bauer proposed cutting out the entire tumor in one procedure jacks parents michael and lisa deliso were fearful that if nerves were damaged during surgery his ability to walk as well as his bladder and bowel function could be impaired the technology was reassuring they explained to us that they were able to take the pictures with the mri while they were operating to make sure they got everything without having to damage nerves or disturb the tumor mr deliso says jack says he was calm going into surgery because it just had to be done and there was no use being scared of it he was tired of lying awake at night when he says he felt excruciating pain during the 12hour procedure surgeons could see only the back of jacks spine because they didnt know if the tumor was malignant they were determined to avoid cutting into it which could spread potentially cancerous cells elsewhere in the body as they drilled into bones to detach and remove the tumor they used a ct scan of the spine to help navigate accurately and avoid removing bone that wasnt directly involved next they performed an mri to make sure the nerve roots were unscathed and they hadnt missed any part of the mass toward the end of the procedure they did a second ct scan which showed there was enough bone left so jack wouldnt need reconstruction with rods screws and bone grafts they finished up and closed the incision jack was in the hospital for three nights a week later pathology tests came back showing the tumor had been benign and the surgeons had gotten all of it now 9 years old jack says he would like to play soccer or footballand be an orthopedic surgeon when he grows up intraoperative scanning is costly for hospitals for example imris inc of canada makes visius surgical theatre systems found in 87 operating rooms worldwide including at brigham and womens and at dartmouth each system consists of a two or threeroom suite with mri units costing from about 3 million to 7 million and ct scanners ranging from about 15 million to 35 million jay miller president and chief executive says over 17000 procedures have been performed to date with imris systems intraoperative imaging has its own risks says bernadette henrichs director of the nurse anesthesia program at barnesjewish college and nurse anesthesia research and education at washington university school of medicine both in st louis because of the strong magnetic force used in mri ferrous metal objects and tools must be kept out of the operating room along with pagers cellphones jewelry and hair pins anesthesia teams stay with patients during scans and use equipment such as aluminum oxygen tanks and instruments made from plastic titanium and other materials compatible with mri at barnesjewish hospital or teams get training before they can work with live mri imaging they do annual safety drills including emergency procedures in the event a patient has a cardiac arrest while undergoing a scan these are exciting advances but we have to be vigilant in making sure patients and healthcare workers arent harmed and take necessary safety precautions ms hendrichs says in imageguided operating suites surgeons see realtime mri ct scans

fake,take a deep breath and relax behind that common piece of advice is a complex series of physiological processes that calm the body slow the heart and help control pain breathing and controlling your breath is one of the easiest ways to improve mental and physical health doctors and psychologists say slow deep and consistent breathing has been shown to have benefits in treating conditions ranging from migraines and irritable bowel syndrome to anxiety disorders and pain if you train yourself to breathe a little bit slower it can have longterm health benefits said murali doraiswamy a professor of psychiatry at duke university medical center in durham nc deep breathing activates a relaxation response he said potentially decreasing inflammation improving heart health boosting your immune system and maybe even improving longevity to help foster the habit of healthful breathing a san francisco technology startup recently launched a wearable device called spire that tracks breathing patterns and tells users when they are too tense or anxious one of the goals of this work was how do you make it so simple to shift into calm or focus that people dont have to stop what theyre doing said neema moraveji cofounder of spire and director of the calming technology lab at stanford university many early buyers of the 150 spire are office workers who spend a lot of time on computers research has found people working on computers often hold their breath an action referred to as screen apnea he said belisa vranich a new york citybased clinical psychologist has been conducting breathing workshops around the country for just over a year among her biggest clients corporate managers eager to learn how to better manage stress dr vranich says she instructs clients to breathe with their abdomen on the inhale this encourages the diaphragm to flatten out and the ribs to flare out most of us by instinct breathe vertically using our chest shoulders and neck she says abdominal or diaphragmatic breathing is often taught in yoga and meditation classes experts say air should be breathed in through the nose and the exhale should be longer than the inhale dr vranich recommends trying to breathe this way all the time but other experts say it is enough to use the technique during stressful or tense times or when it is necessary to focus or concentrate slow breathing stimulates the vagus nerve which runs from the stem of the brain to the abdomen it is part of the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for the bodys rest and digest activities by contrast the sympathetic nervous system regulates many of our fight or flight responses the vagusnerve activity causes the heart rate to decrease as we exhale said richard gevirtz a psychology professor at alliant international university in san diego vagal activity can be activated when breathing at about five to seven breaths a minute said dr gevirtz compared with average breathing rates of about 12 to 18 breaths a minute the vagus nerves response includes the release of different chemicals including acetylcholine a neurotransmitter that acts as an antiinflammatory and slows down digestion and the heart rate said stephen silberstein director of the jefferson headache center at thomas jefferson university in philadelphia who is working on an article on the vagus nerve and its functions getty images when medical conditions are severe such as with epilepsy medical devices are sometimes implanted to stimulate the vagus nerve for most people slow steady breathing is a natural way to stimulate the nerve certain conditions including asthma and panic disorders have been shown to benefit from a different breathing techniquetaking shallow breaths through the nose at a regular rhythmic speed of eight to 13 breaths a minute for these patients already anxious about their symptoms deep breathing can cause them to take in too much air and hyperventilate heartratevariability biofeedback uses breathing to train people to increase the variation in their heart rate or the interval between heartbeats the technique has been shown to have benefits for conditions including anxiety disorders and asthma biofeedback also makes breathing more efficient said paul lehrer a clinical psychologist at robert wood johnson medical school part of rutgers university in new jersey on average most people reach this balance when breathing 11 seconds per breath spire the device that tracks individual breathing patterns is a pedometerlike device that can be clipped onto pants or a bra strap and can sense breathing patterns without touching the skin a sensor detects subtle torso expansions and contractions said stanfords dr moraveji the device identifies peoples baseline breathing patterns and can tell users when they are tense or may need to take a deep breath it includes an app that guides people in breathing exercises as short as 30 seconds dr moravejis research includes a 2011 stanford study of 13 students that found subjects on average took 167 breaths a minute when they were doing normal computer work compared with 93 breaths a minute when they were relaxed he said the study was published in the proceedings of the annual acm symposium on user interface software and technology a followup study involving 14 subjects found that giving feedback of breathing patterns on a computer screen allowed the subjects to control their breathing without decreasing their performance on an analytical task dr moraveji said we proved that because the breath is so easily controllable you dont have to interrupt your task in order to regulate your nervous system he said the study was presented at the acm chi conference on human factors in computing systems in 2012 dr vranich the breathing coach believes teaching people to unlearn dysfunctional breathing habits requires practice and exercises her group classes cost 150 for a threehour workshop and private classes range from 350 to 450 on a recent afternoon she held a private session in her manhattan studio with joe march a 40yearold new york city firefighter who said he wanted to improve his lung capacity and condition for brazilian jujitsu a form of martial arts he practices dr vranich positions many of her clients upside down to better exercise the diaphragm muscles she assisted mr march into a shoulder stand against a wall as she monitored his breathing inhale relax and see if you can expand right by your diaphragm she said exhale squeeze your ribs at the same time earl winthrop a 60yearold partner of a boston wealthmanagement firm is another of dr vranichs clients when i was working on the computer i wasnt breathing properly said mr winthrop who now does tailored breathing exercises and short bouts of meditative breathing im much more aware now i feel more focused i can calm myself down he said breathing for your better health

fake,monday oct 1 2012 healthday news a new anticlotting drug called apixaban was better than warfarin at preventing stroke in patients with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation a new study found data from more than 18000 patients also found that apixaban was safer overall than warfarin and tended to cause less bleeding in the skull in patients who faced the highest risk of bleeding the findings suggest that the current risk scoring systems for tailoring anticlotting anticoagulant treatment to individual patients may be less relevant when using apixaban for patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for stroke according to the duke university medical center researchers the benefits of apixaban are preserved regardless of the risk score used and regardless of the patient risk category study author and cardiologist dr renato lopes said in a duke news release with new oral anticoagulants such as apixaban we might not need risk scores to guide treatment decisions for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation this may simplify how physicians make decisions and also improve patient care study coinvestigator dr jack ansell agreed this analysis provides further support for the benefit of apixaban but given the very low risk of bleeding with apixaban it also suggests that the current stroke and bleeding risk scores may not be sensitive enough to tease out those patients with the very lowest risk of stroke who might benefit from apixaban therapy said ansell who is chairman of the department of medicine at lenox hill hospital in new york city and a consultant to bristolmyers squibb and pfizer the companies that are marketing the drug as eliquis the drug has not yet been approved by the us food and drug administration the study was published online oct 1 in the lancet apixaban showed a 21 percent relative reduction in the incidence of strokes or systemic embolisms clots when compared to warfarin a 31 percent relative reduction in major bleeding and an 11 percent relative reduction in overall mortality the researchers found atrial fibrillation affects more than 26 million people in the united states in people with atrial fibrillation disorganized electrical activity causes ineffective contraction of the upper chambers of the heart this increases the risk for blood clots that can cause stroke current practice guidelines permit the use of either anticlotting therapy with aspirin or warfarin aspirin is less effective than warfarin but carries a lower risk of bleeding for patients with atrial fibrillation and one risk factor for stroke more information the us national heart lung and blood institute has more about atrial fibrillation new anticlotting drug bests warfarin study says
fake,cincinnati dawne gardnerdavis almost skipped the free health screening for her son the weather was rotten an earlier appointment ran long and 15yearold jordan was the picture of health today the cincinnati mother of two is thankful she didnt doctors diagnosed jordan with aortic root dilation a potentially lifethreatening heart defect they advised the teen who played six sports his favorite being baseball to quit competitive athletics for good for decades pediatricians and family physicians have sought a more effective way to identify young athletes at risk of dying while playing the sports they love now the heart institute at cincinnati childrens hospital medical center is testing a new method in the most complete test of its kind the institute is using both an electrocardiogram and limited echocardiogram to see the rhythm and structure of the heart if proved effective it could become the norm for identifying heart conditions that put one in 10000 people at risk when doing toplevel physical activities researchers say since the study began about a year ago 500 local teens have been screened and 26 diagnosed with heart abnormalities twentytwo can continue in athletics though theyll require lifelong monitoring four young athletes two girls and two boys have been advised to quit sports altogether researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before theyre done so far their work is turning up a higher rate of heart abnormalities than expected jordan was one of the more serious cases that day at his appointment he his mother and little sister jaelynne sat astonished as doctors described a dangerously large root in jordans heart because of its size it could rupture if stressed by too much physical activity the effects could kill him jordan took his doctors advice and quit the sports he loved the saddest day for me had to be the day of baseball tryouts jordan says i woke up and i couldnt go to tryouts after that i just started to cope precise diagnoses sought cases of high school athletes collapsing and dying on sports fields most often result from undiagnosed heart defects says dr jeffrey towbin codirector and head of clinical care at the heart institute victims often show no earlier symptoms looking the picture of health towbin asked two pediatric cardiologists dr jeff anderson and dr michelle grenier to take on the study that hed wanted to do since joining the heart institute 3 and onehalf years ago one of our goals is to advance the field in areas either untouched or unappreciated as being important towbin says these cases are obviously each a tragic event that occur in every city a few times a year as high school sports begin this year the caution takes on increased urgency locally swimmer jose cerda navarro became unconscious during practice with his private swim club in october 2010 he died within the hour at the hospital on this 18th birthday cameron batson 18 died a few weeks before that while playing a game of pickup soccer he had graduated that spring from high school in covington in the united states a doctor must approve participation in a school or competitive sports league approval is generally granted to teens with little to no family history of heart problems and a physical exam devoid of medical red flags some years ago italy instituted a countrywide rule requiring competitive athletes to undergo an electrocardiogram a test that records the electrical activity of the heart fewer italian athletes died after the testing began but the tests also had a relatively high rate of falsely reporting medical problems that led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes theres got to be a better way anderson said thats what we set out to answer anderson and grenier now say that adding a limited echocardiogram a twodimensional image of the heart can offer a more precise diagnosis national estimates are that roughly 1 of people are born with potentially lifethreatening heart defects but the childrens hospital study is showing more than twice that rate and a higher rate for more minor abnormalities as well perhaps because of better technology grenier says i do think theyre real numbers she says of the studys findings so far are they normal variations what abnormality is going to contribute to the overall health versus something that just looks funny thats not entirely known grenier and her colleagues at the heart institute hope to continue this study turn it into an ongoing program so they may one day be able to answer those questions in the meantime screenings continue making tests affordable accessible a key challenge now is making these tests affordable most medical insurance plans wont cover them currently an ekg and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of 2500 anderson says simons fund a nonprofit organization donated 5000 to honor cerda navarro for screenings childrens hospital paid the rest around 42000 according to childrens spokesman jim feuer if an ongoing program of testing happens the hospital would try to tap into thirdparty funding donations and grants towbin says the hope would be that with data we could get the entire system interested in participating get funding to run a clinical trial locally and maybe nationally after jordans diagnosis his family packed the room to support him for every subsequent appointment he now takes daily blood pressure medication and is allowed to jog and do other light physical activities he grew up around athletics so im sure it was a culture shock for him says his grandfather lacey calloway whatever he does he knows weve got his back even if its tiddlywinks sports teaches discipline gardnerdavis says but her son is finding that in other interests jordan plays the drums in a high school concert band is getting into photography and cars now that hes 16 and he got a summer job at great american ballpark gardnerdavis calls the decision to take him for that screening the best decision of my life and suggests other parents take advantage of the free service were so thankful she says otherwise wed have no idea and jordan could be standing here one day and gone the next heart study helps save lives of young athletes
fake,after her mother unexpectedly died from a tear in the wall of her heart at age 63 patricia walters talked to her doctor leslie cho about how to better monitor her own heart health pregnant at the time with her own daughter ms walters now 46 says she was a nervous wreck worrying that she too might face serious cardiac risk as part of an overall health evaluation after the pregnancy dr cho director of the womens cardiovascular center at the cleveland clinic recommended a simple blood test called hscrpfor high sensitivity creactive protein which is a marker for inflammation in the body easily done at the same time as a cholesterol screening and covered by most insurance the test is increasingly being used as a routine screening tool for patients with one or two risk factors to help assess their heartattack and stroke risk greater accuracy the hscrp test is a newer more sensitive version of a standard crp check and experts say it can more accurately detect lower concentrations of the protein making it more useful in predicting a healthy persons risk for cardiovascular disease it measures crp in milligrams per liter of blood less than 10 mgl is considered low risk 10 to 30 mgl is average risk and greater than 30 mgl is considered high risk for cardiovascular disease the american heart association and the american college of cardiology both have endorsed the use of hscrp for intermediate risk individuals and one major study suggests that even people with minimal risk factors in their late 50s and early 60s should have the test while inflammation is the bodys natural response to a variety of physical states including fever injury and infection research shows it also plays a role in a range of chronic illnesses including cardiovascular disease inflammation of the arteries has been linked to heart attack sudden death and stroke dr cho notes those who smoke have high blood pressure and are overweight and sedentary tend to have high levels of crpand those who are thin and fit have lower levels but genetic factors can also contribute to elevated crp in people without traditional risk factors research shows that elevated levels of crp are at least as predictive of cardiac risk as cholesterol levels a 1997 study of healthy physicians published in the new england journal of medicine was the first to show that relative risk of first heart attack or stroke was directly related to elevated crp levels and the harvard womens health study which looked at 12 different markers of inflammation in healthy postmenopausal women found that after three years crp was the strongest predictor of risk notsolow risk while some experts dont think the hscrp test adds much to current cardiovascular riskprediction strategies others say a large study known as the jupiter trial supports broad use of the test to find people who may assume their low cholesterol levels protect them from heart troubleand determine whether they might be candidates for treatment with statin drugs the 2008 study showed that in patients with low levels of ldlthe bad cholesterolbut high hscrp levels the statin crestor reduced the risk of heartrelated death heart attacks and other serious cardiac problems by 44 compared with those given placebos paul ridker a harvard university researcher who led the jupiter study says we know that those with elevated hscrp are at high risk even if cholesterol levels are low and that statin therapy can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in this group while the study showed inflammation contributes as much to cardiovascular risk as does high blood pressure or high cholesterol dr ridker says the core research question now is whether or not reducing inflammation per se will reduce that risk his team has now launched two major clinical trialsone funded by the federal government and one by industryto address that question dr ridker is coinventor on patents held by brigham and womens hospital related to the use of inflammatory biomarkers including hscrp in evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease something to talk about dr cho at the cleveland clinic says the test can help identify those patients at intermediate risk and open the discussion about prevention and treatment if you are 53 and chubby with high blood pressure and borderline high cholesterol but your crp is normal im not sure i would throw the whole kitchen sink at you says dr cho but if your crp was elevated i would want to talk to you about the jupiter results and discuss starting a statin she also counsels patients with elevated levels about lifestyle changes including weight loss nutrition and exercise ms walters didnt have high levels when she was first tested but they began to rise in later screenings she now takes a statin and has her blood monitored regularly she also joined weight watchers to drop a few pounds and runs with friends for exercise a former teacher who is now a stayathome mom ms walters says i have a little girl and i plan to be here for everything ms landro is an assistant managing editor for the wall street journal and writes the papers informed patient column she can be reached at next com corrections amplifications

fake,about 28 million americans have sleep apnea which causes repeated awakenings and pauses in breathing during the night sometimes resulting in loud snoring and gasps for air for decades the standard treatment has been continuous positive airway pressure a mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages enabling easier breathing cpap reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea joseph a golish md but the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie big bulky and obtrusive many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep studies show that about half of all people prescribed cpap machines stop using them in one to three weeks for a lot of people out there the cpap machine turns into a doorstop said dr joseph golish the former chief of sleep medicine at the cleveland clinic and now a professor with the metrohealth system in cleveland cpap is very effective in the sleep lab but when people go home theres a good chance they wont use it and the success rate of an unused cpap machine is absolutely zero now an alternative form of cpap is gaining popularity a patch that fits over the nostrils called provent the patch holds two small plugs one for each nostril that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night it is far less intrusive than the traditional cpap machine it is also more expensive and it doesnt work for every patient approved by the food and drug administration in 2008 provent has spread mostly by word of mouth but it has caught on fast its manufacturer ventus medical says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months up from a half million total in the two years prior doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea and many patients who struggled with cpap call it a godsend bob bleck who owns a computer networking firm in ohio struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades but it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic prodded by his wife who worried about his heavy snoring the diagnosis was severe sleep apnea tests showed that in a typical night mr bleck 47 awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour his doctor prescribed a cpap machine and mr bleck hated it i had this constricted feeling he said it would be incorporated into these dreams where i was tied up like in the movie alien it was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea mr bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered provent after i started using it i noticed a difference right away he said my symptoms subsided dramatically provent works like a traditional cpap machine but is only a fraction of the size when people with apnea fall asleep their throat muscles collapse constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air cpap machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting provent does too but in a different way the device contains two pinholesize valves one over each nostril the valves let air in easily most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep but there is resistance as the user exhales that resistance creates a backpressure in the airways dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night in the morning the patch is removed a new one is used every night last year in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal sleep and subsidized by ventus researchers found that those who used provent devices over a threemonth period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply compared with people who were given a sham or placebo device a followup study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results but not everyone finds that provent alleviates their apnea in interviews sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it it works like a champ in some people and doesnt work on other people said dr nancy appelblatt an ear nose and throat surgeon in sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients all sleep apnea is not created equal some people for example breathe through the mouth at night not the nostrils in those people provent typically doesnt work nor will it work very well in someone who has severe nasal allergies and has a blocked nose at night said one of the leaders of the provent studies dr meir h kryger a professor at yale medical school and founder of the national sleep foundation unlike cpap provent is not covered by medicare and most major insurers though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future in the meantime a 30day supply of the patches costs 65 to 80 dr lee a surkin a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in greenville nc said patients typically start with a 10day trial pack that costs 2750 he has prescribed provent to about 300 of his patients the no 1 reason people dont continue it is the outofpocket expense he said for now dr kryger and others say that cpap will continue to be the gold standard and certainly the first option for patients with severe apnea but for the roughly 50 percent of patients in whom cpap fails provent may be a reliable alternative dr surkin said some patients use cpap at home but take their pocketsize provent patches with them when they travel to avoid the hassle of lugging a machine through airports to me its a miracle said joyce nemoga 64 ms nemoga who lives in baldwin harbor ny has moderate apnea that caused her to snore and gasp in her sleep she tried cpap but could not sleep comfortably with the device every time you turn over you have to take the hose with you she said i tried it for six months and i dont think i had one full night of sleep the whole time a doctor

fake,saturday march 31 2012 healthday news a noninvasive scan might someday help doctors track the progress of prostate cancer and help guide treatment researchers report the imaging tool known as a prostate cancerspecific radiotracer has so far only been tested successfully in mice but a team from memorial sloankettering cancer center in new york city said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone radiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients using positron emission tomography also known as a pet scan doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread in studies involving mice with prostate cancer the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostatespecific antigen psa the same prostate cancer marker used in the psa test they found that the psa gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormonebased therapies the study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone the researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions the findings were to be presented saturday at the american association for cancer research annual meeting in chicago and are also being published in cancer discovery if used on people the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors personalize treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease the ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes michael j evans research fellow in the human oncology and pathogenesis program at memorial sloankettering cancer center explained in meeting news release encouraged by their findings the studys authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year two prostate cancer experts said the tool if borne out in patients could prove very useful dr michael schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at north shorelij health system in lake success ny he noted that as of now doctors typically rely on results of the psa blood test andor standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions both methods have their limits and while this study is very preliminary if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients it could become extremely useful in either the pre or posttreatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm schwartz said it also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions dr erik goluboff an attending urologist at beth israel medical center new york city agreed that this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect psaexpressing tissues throughout the body he believes that the new tools greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in psa expression in tissues as a result of various treatments if a treatment showed a marked change it could continue to be used in that patient hence personalized medicine if a specific change did not occur that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead since these changes could not be detected based on a psa blood test alone this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient however goluboff also noted that research from animalbased studies does not always pan out in humans and further larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings more information the us national cancer institute provides more information on prostate cancer new scanning technology might help guide prostate cancer care

fake,food allergies are tricky business theyre on the rise in the united states and no one knows why some children are allergic to many foods and its impossible to know based on preventive testing whether someone will have a mild or severe reaction and so far theres no cure researchers at johns hopkins university and duke university are working on a treatment that may one day allow kids with allergies to safely eat the foods that cause them lifethreatening reactions its still in the early stages but dr robert wood of johns hopkins who has been on the forefront of food allergy research estimates the treatment could be brought to the public within six to eight years in his new study researchers explored a treatment for children with cows milk allergies the strategy is to desensitize the child by giving small amounts of the allergen milk oral immunotherapy swallowing small amounts of the allergen has shown to be more effective than sublingual therapy which involves putting even tinier quantities of milk under the persons tongue wood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18 these kids were severely allergic to cows milk wood presented the study published in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology at the 2012 annual meeting of the american academy of allergy asthma immunology this weekend the results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy still it did not eliminate all symptoms this is particularly important because about 20 of the kids that wood and colleagues work with have significant reactions during the treatment that make the therapy unfeasible wood said some participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies wood said but only onethird have longterm protection others need regular exposure to milk in order to maintain protection against allergic reactions with milk thats not too hard wood says because one could eat pizza a couple of times a week its not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults since there have been so few participants in this research the big barrier to broadening the scope of the research is funding wood said this is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy wood said other research has shown that immunotherapy techniques may similarly work for children with peanut allergies but tree nuts may be harder to treat wood said because treenut allergic individuals often have multiple kinds of nuts they cant eat researchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab xolair approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of severe asthma to see if it could help people with food allergies too do not try the immunotherapy technique at home these experiments are conducted under medical supervision experimental treatment may help food allergies

fake,a new report highlights a novel way for doctors to replace thinning hairlines transplanting leg hair the report a study of two cases published in the archives of dermatology describes a new procedure in which receding hairlines were restored by taking hair follicles from patients legs and grafting them to the head mens leg hair had successfully been transplanted before to the back of the head but these are believed to be the first documented cases of leg hair being used to restore the hairline the procedure has the potential to restore the hairlines of millions of men with male pattern baldness the most common cause of hair loss and often an enormous source of stress the condition also called androgenic alopecia typically begins at the hairline and eventually creates a horseshoeshaped pattern of hair around the ears it stems from a sensitivity largely genetic to the effects of hormones on hair follicles in traditional transplants hair follicles are taken from an area that runs an inch or two above the ears and temples to the back of the head dermatologists can transplant follicles from this area called the safe donor zone because hair follicles there are impervious to the hormones that cause hair loss to the front of the head without worrying that the hair that grows from them will fall out but hair that comes from the back of the head is typically much coarser than the fine hair that grows in front if you look at a natural hairline its very soft like baby hair said dr sanusi umar an associate instructor of dermatology at the medical school of the university of california los angeles and author of the new report the back of the head is where you find the thickest hair on the head if you take that hair and use it in the hairline it can end up looking harsh and pluggy because the hair is too thick dr umar was inspired to develop the procedure in part from personal experience in 1996 as a medical internist with thinning hair he underwent a traditional hair transplant procedure but was unhappy with the results that inspired me to go into dermatology he said after reading a 2008 report showing it was possible for transplanted leg hair to survive and grow naturally on the back of a mans head dr umar realized its potential to create softer more naturallooking hairlines if you transplant leg hair on the head its not going to start acting like head hair it will still grow shorter and slower than scalp hair he said at his clinic in redondo beach calif dr umar tried the technique on two patients one a 35yearold man who was embarrassed by the results of a traditional hair transplant to restore his hairline he was selfconscious about the problem and resorted to styling his hair forward to obscure the hairline dr umar wrote in his report the other patient a 29yearold man who had also undergone a traditional transplant was likewise unhappy about his hairline which he felt was too harsh and straight dr umar wrote he had resorted to cropping his hair short to obscure the problem with the patients under local anesthesia dr umar used a device that creates microscopic wounds around hair follicles in the back of the leg the follicles were then removed and transplanted to the hairline the hairs were removed in a diffuse pattern so there were no bald spots on the legs after the procedure because these are very tiny wounds they heal and close up with minimal scarring he said in each case dr umar and his team extracted about 1000 leg hair follicles and grafted them one by one to the patients hairlines about 75 to 80 percent of the transplanted leg hair grew successfully on the patients heads after the operations and both men were happy with the results dr umar said the hairline was fully grown and softlooking by nine months in the 35yearold he wrote at which time the patient started combing his hair backward and sporting a ponytail exposing his hairline comfortably since then dr umar has done eight more of the procedures including one in a woman on average a procedure involves 1500 to 1800 follicles and takes about eight hours with breaks a lot of these patients have no other options or alternatives he added theyve been told to forget about it by many other clinics its lifealtering for them when they realize that this is possible a new approach to treating hair loss

fake,fred r conradthe new york times a new study reports that beer is an excellent recovery beverage for marathon runners but you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet the beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic running a marathon is of course punishing to the body causing muscle soreness and inflammation grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event some athletes particularly in europe long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training claiming that it helped them to recover but no science existed to support the practice to study the matter researchers at the technical university of munich approached healthy male runners most in their early 40s who were training for the munich marathon and asked if they would in the name of science be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer two hundred seventyseven men agreed even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic only half of the group received the alcoholfree beer however the other half got a similarly flavored placebo no one knew who was drinking what all of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half about two to three pints of their assigned beverage every day beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward the scientists meanwhile collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race as well as immediately before to the start at the finish line and on select days afterward these were an exceptionally obliging group of racers it seems they monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the mens blood to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running for the next two weeks the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew they also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time the men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 325fold lower in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers the scientists reported in the journal medicine science in sports exercise they also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation as measured by various markers in their blood and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group an indication of overall better immune system health these effects matter said dr johannes scherr lead author of the study because if a marathon runners body is less sore and inflamed after a race and he doesnt develop the sniffles he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to it can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions in those drinking beer he wrote in an email response just how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated but said dr scherr it almost certainly involves the beverages rich bouquet of polyphenols chemical substances found in many plants that among other things suppress viral replication and influence the innate immune system positively all beneficial for fighting off a cold alcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols too even more than nonalcoholic beer dr scherr said but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic we do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols he wrote furthermore it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day especially not during strenuous training we all knew that right of course other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise and then underperformed in followup studies quercetin for instance a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals but the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes an analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the american college of sports medicine annual meeting in june concluded that quercetin supplementation is very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage but the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice it began with human marathoners completing a punishing unsimulated race and showed demonstrable benefits in terms of minimizing postrace damage all of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets dr scherr said when i look at the results of our study i would have to answer yes its possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods he added like those trainingtable staples chokeberries and mangosteens as well as pomegranates and grapes but with these foods you do not consume the minerals fluid and carbohydrates he said so nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal for everything perhaps apart from your welldeserved celebratory carouse after the race for that at least the beer can be fullpotency nonalcoholic beer aids marathon recovery

collagen cells which are multiplied in a lab to create an injectable substance that smoothes out facial features injections typically cost a fraction of surgery and require much less recuperation time its taking hold people are doing injections a lot more frequently said john bull a plastic surgeon in naperville people that are looking for a modest improvement with less down time and no scars typically want to have this done the best candidates are people with early signs of aging and volume loss laurette agee 51 who is general manager of a mcdonalds in aurora was a patient of bulls more than four years after losing her husband of 26 years agee was ready to come out of her shell but noticed the aging process taking hold she did not warm to the idea of plastic surgery so starting in february she began receiving different types of injections in her cheeks lips and along the sides of her nostrils i catch men looking at me now in a different perspective it makes me feel very good agee said at my sons wrestling meets other moms were like did you have something done laurette you look so good i have no shame in saying i did this and this and this in the last decade minimally invasive procedures have skyrocketed in popularity from 55 million performed in 2000 to 116 million in 2010 a 110 percent increase according to the american society of plastic surgeons the bestknown and most commonly used botox jumped 584 percent cosmetic surgical procedures were done 18 percent less often in 2010 than in 2000 with considerably larger drops in facelifts 65 percent forehead lifts 57 percent eyelid surgery 36 percent chin augmentation 55 percent and nose reshaping 35 percent the society reports the new product called laviv and approved by the federal drug administration in late june is what chicago plastic surgeon julius few describes as another tool in our chest it will take awhile to reach market and will be more expensive than other injectables at least initially few said its not going to be one of these things where people are going to put down their other options like botox overnight he said as this continues to develop and is modified and enhanced as an application hopefully it will approach a cost point similar to some of the other options and have a broader application my experience given past history is that the concept of using a patients own material and then enriching it is expensive thomas mustoe a plastic surgeon and professor of surgery at northwestern memorial hospital also expects laviv to be costly and expressed skepticism that it will necessarily work better than other nonsurgical options he said the fda approval indicates that the procedure is safe and can work but patients should not necessarily conclude more this is certainly significant that you have approval mustoe said it is going to be simple to inject but what is unknown is whether it is going to turn out to be better than other fillers were still sorting out what is possible with a needle and an injection part of the reason for the popularity of injectables is the cost bull said they typically are no more than half the cost of surgery which can run from 5000 to

fake,back to previous page new laser treatment takes aim at toenail fungus by rachel saslow for people with toenail fungus there is no good time to wear sandals not even at the beach in july toenail fungus causes nails to become thick yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs topical treatments and home remedies sometimes to no avail it tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks the problem is huge it is bigger than you can imagine says washington podiatrist stephen j kominsky i would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails there may be hope podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection or wastes their patients money because it doesnt work depending on whom you ask the treatment in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patients toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus costs about 1000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure the nails arent immediately clear after the treatment which takes up to an hour the patient must wait for the fungusfree nails to grow out last year the food and drug administration cleared the first laser pinpointe for temporary increase of clear nail in patients with onychomycosis the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail the fda cleared a second one genesisplus in april practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about 2009 no side effects kominsky has treated 400 to 500 patients with the pinpointe laser compared with oral medication he says the odds of success are better with the laser plus theres no side effects the most common oral treatment lamisil works for about two out of three patients according to lamisils fdaapproved prescribing information but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems other potential side effects include diarrhea headache rashes and changes in taste according to lamisils manufacturer novartis the relapse rate is 15 percent one year after completing treatment in one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus which appeared last year in the journal of the american podiatric medical association 26 eligible toes ten mild seven moderate and nine severe were treated with a laser produced by nomir medical technologies which is still seeking fda approval after six months 85 percent of the toenails had improved i never use the term cured with toenail fungus kominsky says with a cure people think theres no chance for a recurrence in this case there is a chance even john strisower the founder of pinpointe usa says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment routes of infection research done by pinpointe which is based in chico calif identified more than 100 organisms including fungi yeast mold and bacteria that work together to cause toenail fungus theres no one route of infection but sources include pedicures and locker room showers fungi love moist dark environments such as wet shoes kominsky says so people such as lifeguards landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus which can also occur the elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems cant always fight it off according to washington podiatrist lee firestone he estimates that about half of people over 70 have toenail fungus last year americans spent 354 million on prescription and overthecounter treatments for toenail fungus according to ims health a healthcare information company firestone typically recommends oral medication for patients with toenail fungus i think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail but its only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement says firestone who doesnt use the lasers in his practice ive had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen longterm success vinegar wont work firestone also says that overthecounter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they cant penetrate the nail root home remedies such as tea tree oil bleach and vinegar also dont work he says yet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many richard a retiree in fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus got a laser treatment on all 10 toes in april 2010 and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed thickened look after a year to prevent reinfection he has purchased all new socks and a sterishoe a 130 device that uses ultraviolet light to sanitize shoes at his podiatrists recommendation he has also turned to what he calls an old wives tale that he read about in a newspaper column slathering vicks vaporub on his toes my doctor said listen its not a prescribed treatment but if it works for you for heavens sake do

fake,chicago reuters the longestrunning breast cancer screening study ever conducted has shown that regular mammograms prevent deaths from breast cancer and the number of lives saved increases over time an international research team said on tuesday a doctor exams mammograms a special type of xray of the breasts which is used to detect tumours as part of a regular cancer prevention medical checkup at a clinic in nice south eastern france january 4 2008 reuterseric gaillard the study of 130000 women in two communities in sweden showed 30 percent fewer women in the screening group died of breast cancer and that this effect persisted year after year now 29 years after the study began the researchers found that the number of women saved from breast cancer goes up with each year of screening weve found that the longer we look the more lives are saved professor stephen duffy of queen mary university of london whose study was published in the journal radiology said in a statement dr stamatia destounis a radiologist at elizabeth wende breast care in rochester new york who was not involved in the study said radiologists have been quoting results of the swedish study for years and the new findings show breast cancer screening is even more of a benefit than we understood she said sweeping changes in the us screening guidelines two years ago that scaled back recommendations on breast cancer screening caused a lot of confusion among doctors and patients about the benefits of mammograms weve had to do a lot of education of the patients and their doctors this will help for that destounis said in the study women were divided into two groups one that received an invitation to have breast cancer screening and another that received usual care the screening phase of the trial lasted about seven years women between 40 and 49 were screened every two years and women 50 to 74 were screened roughly every three years our results indicate that in 1000 women screened for 10 years three breast cancer deaths would be prevented duffy said adding that most of the deaths prevented would have occurred more than a decade after the screening had started this indicates that the longterm benefits of screening in terms of deaths prevented are more than double those often quoted for shortterm followup the new data adds to evidence on the longterm benefits of regular mammography screening screening controversy new breast screening recommendations issued in 2009 by the us preventive services task force an influential advisory group recommended against routine mammograms for women in their 40s and said women in their 50s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year the guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age 40 eliciting protests from breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation for fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer the changes were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps but the latest results from the swedish study show the rate of false positive results was low we saw the actual number of overdiagnosed cases was really very small less than 5 percent of the total robert smith director of cancer screening at the american cancer society and one of the studys authors said in a telephone interview many groups including the american cancer society have stuck by their longstanding recommendations of a yearly breast exam for women starting at age 40 stressing that the breast xrays have been proven to save lives by spotting tumors early when they are most easily treated i think for anybody who was beginning to have their faith shaken in the value of mammography these data show mammography is quite valuable as a public health approach to reducing deaths from breast cancer smith said duffy said he thinks screening women 40 to 54 every 18 months and screening women 55 and older every two years would be a reasonable schedule he said the new findings do not speak to the frequency of screening issue but they do make clear that screening works everyone must make up their own mind but certainly from combined results from all the screening trials mammography in women aged 4049 does reduce deaths from breast cancer he said breast cancer is the secondleading cause of cancer death among us women after lung cancer it kills 500000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 13 million people around the world benefit of mammograms even greater than thought

fake,regular fasting may be good for your heart thats the finding of a new study from doctors in utah who looked at the relationship between periodic fasting and cardiovascular disease the researchers interviewed 200 patients who were undergoing a diagnostic test called angiography an xray exam of the blood vessels and heart chambers that can determine if a person has coronary heart disease the patients were asked if they engaged in regular fasting and the researchers compared the answers to whether they eventually received a diagnosis of heart disease because about 90 percent of the patients were mormons a faith that encourages its members to fast for one day a month the doctors expected to find a relatively high rate of regular fasting among the study participants the researchers found that people who fasted regularly had a 58 percent lower risk of coronary disease compared with those who said they didnt fast according to the report presented at the american college of cardiology conference in new orleans this week the study showed only an association between fasting and better heart health which means its possible that fasting may not have a direct effect but might just be more common among people who are healthier to begin with devout mormons for instance abstain from alcohol smoking and caffeine which are all factors that could affect heart health but the researchers say the findings are important because they affirm the results of an earlier larger study published in 2008 in the american journal of cardiology that found a similar association between fasting and heart disease among 448 patients the first study we did was not a chance finding said dr benjamin d horne director of cardiovascular and genetic epidemiology for intermountain healthcare a health services and managed care firm in salt lake city we were able to replicate the findings and show that people who fast routinely have a lower prevalence of coronary disease the downside of the study is that it didnt ask for specific details on the type and duration of fasting among the patients however preliminary interviews suggest that the most common form of fasting involved a monthly ritual of abstaining from all food and drinking only water for 24 hours a second smaller study conducted by the same research team suggests that the effects of fasting arent just about having an overall healthy lifestyle but that abstaining from food on a regular basis leads to metabolic changes that are good for the heart for that research also presented at the new orleans conference 30 patients were asked to fast for 24 hours with water only the scientists used blood tests before and after the fasting period to look at a number of different metabolic markers among other changes they found that levels of human growth hormone or hgh surged after fasting increasing 20 times in men and 13 times in women the hormone is released by the body in times of starvation to protect lean muscle mass and trigger the body to start burning fat stores there is a lot more to be done to fill in the research on the biological mechanism dr horne said but what it does suggest is that fasting is not a marker for other healthy lifestyle behaviors it appears to be that fasting is causing some major stress and the body responds to that by some protective mechanisms that potentially have a beneficial longterm effect on risk of chronic disease dr horne noted that patients shouldnt take up fasting without discussing it first with their doctor any fast should include water because dehydration can raise risk for stroke he said the group was planning additional research into the potential health effects of regular fasting regular fasting may boost heart health

fake,a study finds that use of virtual colonoscopy a noninvasive way of scanning the colon for potentially cancerous growths is on the rise thats a bit of a surprise given that not all medical experts agree on whether the virtual screen is as reliable as a traditional colonoscopy in which doctors insert a scope with a small camera into the colon plus medicare does not currently reimburse patients for routine screening with virtual colonoscopy but does cover evaluations with colonoscopy add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like katie couric who allowed tv cameras in as she got her first test and its clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin but in spite of those challenges megan mchugh at the health research and educational trust in chicago and her team report that about 17 of hospitals in the us now offer the screening test up from 13 in 2005 as its name implies virtual colonoscopy is way to survey the colon without actually using a scope patients lie in a ct scanner which takes a series of pictures from a variety of different angles and a computer compiles the snapshots in two different ways the images can be viewed as two dimensional ct scans which display any possible abnormalities protruding from the lining of the colon or the images can be combined to generate a 3d view of the colon allowing the doctors to fly through the organ looking for any suspicious growths or protrusions the prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same the dreaded colon cleanse that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure the night before the test they start drinking clear liquids and take agents to loosen their stools and empty their colon so any remaining debris isnt mistaken for a tumor during the screen while the virtual colonoscopy does not require the sedation and insertion of a scope that colonoscopy does it involves exposure to a small amount of radiation but according to dr marc gollub director of ct and gastrointestinal radiology at memorial sloankettering cancer center the radiation is much lower than a regular ct scan and has not been proven to be of any risk its similar to the exposure from cosmic radiation you might get on a long airplane flight while a growing body of data suggest that virtual colonoscopy is as sensitive as colonoscopy in picking up potential tumors not all cancer experts agree that its a good alternative to the goldstandard scope while the american cancer society the american college of physicians and other gastroenterology experts recommend virtual screening every five years the us preventive services task force a congressionally mandated but nonfederal independent group of medical experts concluded the evidence wasnt strong enough to justify medicare coverage of the service so which one is right for you virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who cant be sedated for colonoscopy or who simply cant tolerate the scope in mchughs survey hospitals reported that these patients make up the bulk of their use and given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services the virtual scan does involve radiation exposure and if doctors find an abnormality that needs to be removed youll have to undergo a colonoscopy anyway to avoid another colon cleanse consider scheduling a colonoscopy on the same day in case tumors need to be removed but gollub notes that only about 8 of healthy adults getting regularly screened actually have tumors given the fact that more hospitals are offering virtual colonoscopy its worth discussing with your doctor in the end its a matter of personal preference its less important how you get screened just that you do get screened virtual colonoscopy gains in popularity is it right for you

fake,by jenifer goodwin healthday reporter tuesday feb 22 2011 healthday news by analyzing patterns in the brains electrical activity researchers say theyve been able to assess autism risk in children as young as 6 months of age researchers hooked up 79 babies aged 6 to 24 months to an eeg or electroencephalogram which records electrical activity in the brain fortysix of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder while the other 33 had no family history of autism children who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves explained lead study author william bosl a neuroinformatics researcher at childrens hospital boston prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction language or communication but not the fullblown disorder while the children watched people blowing bubbles researchers measured the babies brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms the algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by eegs that the human eye might miss bosl explained when the babies were nine months old researchers could predict who was in the highrisk autism group that is they had a sibling with autism with nearly 80 percent accuracy in this study we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by eeg to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism bosl said when broken out by gender researchers found other differences for example at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the highrisk group with near 100 percent accuracy but accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent not statistically significant at six months of age however they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy though they couldnt do the same for boys that young it seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory bosl said the study is published online feb 22 in bmc medicine eegs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp the technology has been around for awhile developed in the late 1920s it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics but its the newer artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the eegs show bosl said artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes bosl said one of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that its very heterogenous a very highfunctioning person with autism might not be so different from a socalled normal person who is quirky defining the differences may be somewhat subtle eegs are also relatively inexpensive painless and safe bosl said and unlike mris they require no sedation so testing could be put to widespread use he said my hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics bosl said that would be tremendously useful we know early intervention is extremely important right now for a lot of children that means 3 years old what we dont know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be dr joshua ewen a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the kennedy krieger institute in baltimore said the study is well done and looks promising but needs to be replicated also the study predicted who was at high risk of autism but its unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism he noted if it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism then we will have a valuable tool for early detection ewen said early detection continues to be of critical importance as it opens the door to early intervention which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism more information the us national institute of neurological disorders and stroke has more on autism brains electrical activity may help spot infants at high risk for autism

fake,the breast cancer drug tamoxifen may stall the progression of cancer institute lung cancer site href targetblank>nonsmall cell lung cancer in those who take it after breast cancer treatment a new study has found tamoxifen is the oldest of a wide array of medications that block the action of the hormone estrogen in the body researchers have found womens health initiative study href targetblank>growing evidence in recent years that the majority of nonsmall cell lung cancers the most common form of lung cancer respond to estrogen with growth so they wondered whether women taking tamoxifen as an adjunct to their breast cancer treatment might be less likely to develop or die of lung cancer drawing from a meticulously maintained swiss registry of cancer patients researchers followed 6665 breast cancer patients in the swiss canton of geneva 3066 of whom took tamoxifen following breast cancer treatment the researchers found that the tamoxifen group was very slightly less likely to develop lung cancer than breast cancer survivors who did not take the drug but the difference was so small that they concluded it could have been a statistical fluke but deaths from lung cancer were distinctly more numerous among the women who had not taken tamoxifen than among those who had a difference significant enough for researchers to declare that by shutting off one source of fuel to an incipient lung tumor tamoxifen may slow progression of the disease once it has taken hold in a womans lung advertisement researchers writing in the journal cancer suggested that newer estrogen blockers on the market including the osteoporosis drug raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors may also be able to slow the progression of lung cancer estrogen blockers such tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors have significant side effects and are generally used only for women past menopause so theyre unlikely to become drugs for the prevention of lung cancer as they currently are for breast cancer but as researchers learn more about lung cancer and study whether early detection of this deadly cancer can save lives the role of estrogen in helping those cancers take hold and grow will likely get more attention breast cancer drug may slow lung cancers march
fake,london reuters british scientists have discovered a rogue gene which helps cancer spread around the body and say blocking it with the right kind of drugs could stop many types of the disease in their tracks a laboratory researcher in a file photo reutersfile researchers from the university of east anglia said their findings could lead within a decade to the development of new medicines to halt a critical late stage of the disease known as metastasis when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body the culprit gene called wwp2 is an enzymic bonding agent found inside cancer cells the researchers explained in their study published in the journal oncogene monday it attacks and breaks down a naturallyoccurring protein in the body which normally prevents cancer cells from spreading in tests in the laboratory the uea team found that by blocking wwp2 levels of the natural inhibitor protein were boosted and the cancer cells remained dormant surinder soond who worked on the study said it was a novel and exciting approach to treating cancer and the spread of tumors which holds great potential the challenge now is to identify a potent drug that will get inside cancer cells and destroy the activity of the rogue gene said andrew chantry of ueas school of biological sciences who led the research he said this was a difficult but not impossible task and one that would be made easier by the better understanding of the biological processes gained in this early research chantry said in a telephone interview the findings mean drugs could be developed in the next 10 years that could be used to halt the aggressive spread of many forms of cancer including breast cancer brain colon and skin cancer if a drug was developed that deactivated wwp2 he said conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy could be used on primary tumors with no risk of the disease taking hold elsewhere he said his team is now working with other scientists to try to design a drug which could interrupt the genes activity blocking rogue gene may stop cancer spread study
fake,images of the hindu goddess lakshmi often portray her carrying a coconut the symbolism has meant something to east indians for thousands of years and increasingly it resonates for westerners move over pomegranate and acai berry coconuts are the new in food touted by naturalfoods enthusiasts and chased by entrepreneurs looking for a big payday its a good time to own a coconut farm thats for sure said daniel fabricant vice president for government and scientific affairs at the natural products association a trade association in washington fabricant said companies that belong to his organization representing naturalfoods retailers and manufacturers are increasingly offering coconutbased products youve got fiber fats and oils waterbased compounds and youve got the milk he said its a holistic approach the fruits appeal rests in part on this versatility a single coconut produces water nectar flesh milk and even textile fiber that translates into a broad slate of products and in contrast to another natural substance that gets transformed into a wide variety of products petroleum coconuts are viewed as healthy but are they it depends coconut water comes from young green coconuts and contains a winning combination of electrolytes sodium and potassium it is very healthy its an effective drink for rehydration that doesnt bring in the added sugars and the additives said dani little dietitian for the whole foods market on pearl street in boulder a lot of rehydrating beverages have additives whereas the coconut water its super clean coconut oil and milk though are receiving mixed reviews the facts on fats coconut fat is saturated like the fat in lard and butter the healthiest fats those found in olive and canola oils contain more monounsaturated fats which do not raise ldl cholesterol and might even help lower it doctors and dietitians have warned people away from cholesterolboosting saturated fats for years coconut fats are not an exception ive had clients who have added coconut oil to shakes and things like that and their cholesterol has gone up significantly said jessica crandall a denver dietitian who is president of the colorado dietetic association saturated fat clogs your arteries and is not good for heart health i was meeting with a cardiologist recently and he said he doesnt advise coconut oil for any clients the fat issue is complicated by the types of fatty acids found in coconut versus other saturated fats while most other saturated fats contain long chain fatty acids most coconut fats are mediumchain this is advantageous for coconuts because the mediumchain fatty acids are broken down more rapidly by enzymes said little in general she said fats high in mediumchain fatty acids are more healthy than those laden with longchain acids in addition coconut fats are high in lauric acid which many believe acts as an antimicrobial helping prevent viruses fungi and parasites even so little a coconut enthusiast doesnt recommend loading up on coconut fats instead of buying oils or supplements just use the whole coconut what we tend to do with our food supply is take the positive and squeeze it into a pill or jar and think that will take care of everything she said if you focus on coconut oil you lose out on the fiber and you are focusing on a concentrated source of calories its the whole coconut that needs to be talked about the coconut gold rush entrepreneurs are talking about the whole coconut these days some those toiling to make money with coconut water are worried about the coconut supply coconut water is much different from red bull or vitamin water said john craven the founder of bevnetcom a trade publication for the beverage industry if they want to make more they just build more factories craven describes the race to turn coconut water into a big market like iced tea or energy drinks as something akin to a gold rush right now coconut water is all the rage he said with the natural movement being in the forefront right now the timing is right in the past couple of years a couple of brands have figured out the right angle electrolytes and hydration craven estimated the coconutwater market at about 100 million annually right now but companies are doubling their sales year after year by next year he said one company alone vita coco could do 100 million or more in sales he predicted within a few years it will be a billiondollar market mammoth beverage companies like cocacola dr pepper snapple group and pepsico have investments in coconut water grocers shelves add new coconutwater products regularly demand has increased exponentially primarily in mainstream groceries like walmart and costco said arthur gallego a spokesman for the new yorkbased vita coco its trickling down to the mass market the company is growing so quickly he said it had to hunt for coconuts from outside of brazil where it previously harvested most of its fruit now it also gets coconuts from asia the volume is going through the roof said laura sauls a spokeswoman for hermosa beach califbased zico we are seeing new competitors by the week its not just the pure water that is exciting marketers its increasingly being used as an additive too coconut water is very healthy and thats our aim said kevin conrad a sales executive with gofast a denver energy drink that now includes a version containing coconutwater concentrate its healthy and simple too thats one of the attractions said tom rich who is in charge of grocery operations for whole foods rocky mountain region its something you dont have to figure out he said people know what it is and where it grows its simple all the way around douglas brown 3039541395 or djbrown com coconut by the numbers one tablespoon of

fake,tired depressed forgetting things who isnt these days those are also symptoms of a deficiency of b12 a key nutrient needed to make red blood cells and dna and keep the nervous system working right vitamin b12 deficiency is officially considered rare affecting about 1 in 1000 americans according to a 2005 study but the incidence rises with age to about 15 of elderly people the rate is also much higher among people who dont eat meat or dairy products people with absorption problems people taking acidblocking medications and those with type 2 diabetes who take the drug metformin b12 deficiency is much more common than the textbooks and journal articles say it is says alan pocinki an internist in washington dc who routinely tests his patients who fall into those categories he also notes that since the metformin connection was discovered only recently some physicians arent aware of it they assume that if patients complain of numbness and tingling in the feet its a diabetes issue and not a b12 issue other symptoms of low b12 include anemia depression dementia confusion loss of appetite and balance problems longterm deficiency can bring severe anemia nerve damage and neurological changes that may be irreversible just three ounces of clams breaded and fried have about 570 of the daily allowance getty images sometimes the symptoms are subtle internist linda assatourians one of dr pocinkis partners says that a surprising number of her young female patients also have low levels of b12 typically they are healthy and active but they dont eat much meat and they have minor mood memory or balance problems when i supplement their b12 they feel better dr assatourians says its not a controlled study but i see a lot of them i was sort of tired but i thought its winter and im doing too much says jessica riester 27 editor of publications for a germanamerican think tank her b12 level was slightly over 200 picograms per milliliter the normal range is considered 200 to 800 pg per ml after several weeks of b12 injections then 1000 milligrams daily in pill form her b12 is now over 600 pg per ml and she says she feels better my color is better and the shadows under my eyes are gone she says indeed several studies have shown that some symptoms of b12 deficiency particularly early problems with cognitive function can be apparent even when patients blood levels are still in the normal range how much recommended dietary allowances for vitamin b12 by age 06 months 400 nanograms 612 months 500 ng 13 years 900 ng 48 years 12 micrograms 913 years 18 mcg 14 years and older 24 mcg pregnant women 26 mcg nursing mothers 28 mcg source national academy of sciences 1998 still vitamin b12 isnt a miracle pickmeup a performance enhancer a weightloss aid or a quick way to sober up after a long night of drinking as some celebrities and internet marketers claim for people who arent deficient theres no evidence whatsoever that these injections are useful to pep you up says irwin h rosenberg a professor and former dean of the friedman school of nutrition at tufts university taking too much b12 is unlikely to be harmful he adds the excess is simply excreted b12 is one of the newest of the human vitamins identified in 1948 it originates in bacteria yeast and microbes in soil plants cant store it so people get their b12 almost exclusively from meat liver poultry fish and dairy products adults need just 24 micrograms a day the amount in three ounces of beef and can generally store it in fat tissue for several years dr pocinki speculates that some of his very lean patients are b12 deficient because they dont have much fat to store it in some people have trouble absorbing b12 in the first place stomach acid is needed to release it from food particles people who have used acidblocking medications particularly protonpump inhibitors for years may not have enough and many elderly people naturally stop making stomach acid so b12 deficiencies are increasingly common as people age boosting b12 b12 comes almost exclusively from meat liver poultry fish and dairy products some breakfast cereals are also fortified with the vitamin selected food sources of vitamin b12 food micrograms mcg per serving percent dv liver beef braised 1 slice 48 800 clams cooked breaded and fried 3 ounces 342 570 breakfast cereals fortified with 100 of the dv for

recommends that people over age 51 get most of their daily requirement from b12 supplements or cereals fortified with the vitamin that break down more easily in the digestive tract further down the digestive tract b12 must combine with a protein called intrinsic factor to be absorbed into the body without intrinsic factor people absorb much less b12 resulting in a condition called pernicious anemia in which red blood cells dont develop properly left untreated pernicious anemia can bring on neurological changes delusions and hallucinations the discovery that eating large amounts of liver could cure pernicious anemia led to the nobel prize for medicine in 1934 other conditions can also interfere with b12 absorption including celiac disease and crohns disease i thought i was going to die in my sleep because i had so little energy says ellen icochea a senior executive at the federal bureau of investigation who had a very low b12 level along with several major medical problems weekly b12 injections made a dramatic difference it was like wow heres energy she says david h johnson a 54year old wildlife biologist takes b12 shots every three days to cope with the challenges of chronic fatigue syndrome imagine you are on a small roller coaster he says you feel up one day and the next and then you start slumping until youre really flat again b12 comes in pill form and a new nasal spray but injections are the fastest way to correct a severe deficiency since it does not need to be absorbed in the digestive tract many patients learn to inject themselves or have a spouse do it to cut down on doctor visits i have world travelers who take their b12 and needles with them its like traveling with insulin says dr pocinki he says he has seen lowgrade depression lift when patients were given b12 supplements researchers are still investigating possible links between longterm b12 deficiency and other health problems its known for example that b12 and the other b vitamins help reduce homocysteine an amino acid in the bloodstream that may be associated with heart disease but several large prospective studies have not shown that taking b12 supplements reduces the risk its also not clear whether low b12 raises the risk of dementia and alzheimers disease although cognitive impairment brought on by low b12 is sometimes mistaken for alzheimers its really easy to miss and really easy to fix says dr pocinki an additional concern a high level of folic acid can mask symptoms of b12 deficiency and many people are getting more folic acid than they realize since 1996 all enriched flour must contain folic acid to reduce the risk of neuraltube defects a severe malformation that occurs in developing fetuses some studies suggest that having high folic acid can make cognitive damage from low b12 even worse to this day we are concerned about the tradeoff says dr rosenberg who was on the advisory panel that recommended enriching flour write to melinda beck at healthjournal com sluggish confused vitamin b12 may be low
fake,we have found many of the same results said dr hamill professor of kinesiology and the director of the universitys biomechanics laboratory i guess the main thing to note is that as biomechanists we really do not know how orthotics work orthotists say dr niggs sweeping statement does not take into account the benefits their patients perceive the key measure of success said jeffrey p wensman director of clinical and technical services at the orthotics and prosthetics center at the university of michigan is that patients feel better the vast majority of our patients are happier having them than not he said about orthotics that are inserted in shoes seamus kennedy president and coowner of hersco ortho labs in new york said there was an abundance of evidence hundreds of published papers that orthotics can treat and prevent mechanically induced foot problems leading to common injuries like knee pain shinsplints and pain along the bottom of the foot orthotics do work mr kennedy said but choosing the right one requires a great deal of care yet scott d cummings president of the american academy of orthotists and prosthetists says the trade is only now moving toward becoming a science so far most of the focus in that direction has been on rigorously assessing orthotics and prosthetics for other conditions like scoliosis with less work on shoe orthotics for otherwise healthy athletes advertisement continue reading the main story anecdotally we know what designs work and what designs dont work for foot orthotics said mr cummings who is an orthotist and prosthetist at next step in manchester nh but when it comes to science and rigorous studies he added comparatively there isnt a whole lot of evidence out there dr nigg would agree in his studies he found there was no way to predict the effect of a given orthotic consider for example an insert that pushes the foot away from a pronated position or rotated excessively outward you might think it would have the same effect on everyone who pronates but it does not one person might respond by increasing the stress on the outside of the foot another on the inside another might not respond at all unconsciously correcting the orthotics correction thats the first problem we have dr nigg said if you do something to a shoe different people will react differently the next problem is that there may be little agreement among orthotics makers about what sort of insert to prescribe in one study discussed in his new book biomechanics of sport shoes dr nigg sent a talented distance runner to five certified orthotics makers each made a different type of insert to correct his pronation the athlete wore each set of orthotics for three days and then ran 10 kilometers about 6 miles he liked two of the orthotics and ran faster with them than with the other three but the construction of the two he liked was completely different newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by

again later view all new york times newsletters then what dr nigg asked in series of studies do orthotics actually do they turn out to have little effect on kinematics the actual movement of the skeleton during a run but they can have large effects on muscles and joints often making muscles work as much as 50 percent harder for the same movement and increasing stress on joints by a similar amount as for corrective orthotics he says they do not correct so much as lead to a reduction in muscle strength advertisement continue reading the main story in one recent review of published papers dr nigg and his colleagues analyzed studies on orthotics and injury prevention nearly all published studies they report lacked scientific rigor for example they did not include groups that for comparison did not receive orthotics or they discounted people who dropped out of the study even though dropouts are often those who are not benefiting from a treatment being generous about studies with design flaws that could overstate effects dr nigg and his colleagues concluded that custommade orthotics could help prevent and treat plantar fasciitis a common injury to a tendon at the bottom of the foot and stress fractures of the tibia along the shin they added though that the research was inadequate for them to have confidence in those conclusions dr nigg also did his own study with 240 canadian soldiers half of them got inserts and the others for comparison did not those who got inserts had a choice of six different types that did different things to foot positioning each man chose the insert he found most comfortable and wore it for four months the men selected five of the six inserts with equal frequency the findings were somewhat puzzling while the group that used inserts had about half as many injuries defined as pain that kept them from exercising for at least half a day there was no obvious relation between the insert a soldier chose and his biomechanics without it thats why dr nigg says for now it is difficult to figure out which orthotic will help an individual the only indication seems to be that a comfortable orthotic might be better than none at all at least for the activities of people in the military so where does this leave people like jason stallman my friend and colleague at the new york times jason has perfectly flat feet no arch he got his first pair of orthotics at 12 or 13 and has worn orthotics all the time for walking and running ever since about a year ago he decided to try going without them in his everyday life he still wears them when he runs every medical specialist jason has seen tried to correct his flat feet but with little agreement on how to do it advertisement continue reading the main story every new podiatrist or orthopedist he told me would invariably look at his orthotics and say oh these arent any good the lab i use makes much better ones your injury is probably linked to these poorfitting orthotics so he tried different orthotic styles different materials different orthotics labs with every new doctor that is a typical story dr nigg says in fact he adds there is no need to correct a flat foot all jason needs to do is strengthen his foot and ankle muscles and then try running without orthotics dr nigg says he always wondered what was wrong with having flat feet arches he explains are an evolutionary remnant needed by primates that gripped trees with their feet since we dont do that anymore we dont really need an arch he wrote in an email why would we for landing no need for the stance phase no need for the takeoff phase no need thus a flat foot is not something that is bad per se so why shouldnt jason or anyone for that matter just go to a store and buy whatever shoe feels good without worrying about correcting a perceived biomechanical defect that is exactly what you should do dr nigg replied orthotic shoe inserts may work but its not clear why
fake,antidepressants relieve hot flashes by rob stein an antidepressant can help alleviate hot flashes that plague many menopausal women according to new federally funded research a study involving 205 women found those taking the antidepressant lexapro experienced a 47 percent reduction in number of hot flashes they were experiencing and the hot flashes they did have tended to be less severe researchers reported in the journal of the american medical association for years many women took hormones to alleviate hots flashes but hormone use plummeted after the federal governments massive womens health initiative shocked women and doctors by concluding the risks of the medication outweighed its benefits since then many women have been suffering through hot flashes and searching for effective alternatives some small pilot studies have indicated that the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reupdate inhibitors ssris and snris might be effective in the new study ellen freeman of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine in philadelphia and colleagues gave 205 women who were either starting to go through menopause who had already gone through menopause either lexapro or a placebo for eight weeks when the study started the women were having an average of nearly 10 hot flashes each day the number of hot flashes among the women taking lexapro which is also known as escitalopram dropped to about five on average after eight weeksa 47 percent decrease or about 46 fewer hot flashes per day the researchers reported the severity of the hot flashes also decreased among those taking a placebo the number of hot flashes dropped to 643 per day a 33 percent decrease of 32 fewer hot flashes per day lexapro seemed to work even among women who were not anxious or depressed the hot flashes increased after the women stopped taking the drug but not among those taking a placebo although the benefit was modest it appeared to be significant enough that women might consider trying it the researchers said the study is the first to examine whether there are any racial differences in how well an antidepressant works in alleviating hot flashes africanamerican women are more likely than white women to report hot flashes the study found none antidepressants relieve hot flashes
fake,the irony isnt lost on bryan moore and probably not on the driver who slammed into his car on april 1 shattering the lower legs of one of the most highprofile personalinjury attorneys in denver but appreciation of lifes weird turns doesnt translate into physical rehabilitation which is where a nasainspired machine dubbed the alterg antigravity treadmill comes in its a stateoftheart device that allows people with lowerbody injuries to walk and even run in a simulated lowgravity environment for moore whose bulldog lawfirm advertisements adorn area billboards its a godsend from an orthopedic standpoint i got hurt worse than 999 percent of my clients moore said during a recent rehab session with the alterg but this machine is miraculous actually its rooted in science the concept of using advanced differential air pressure technology for weight support was conceived by robert whalen a nasa researcher who was studying the biomechanics of exercise in space the first version arrived in 2007 developed by the namesake company in fremont calif a secondgeneration commercial version came out in october 2009 a recent morning found moore gearing up for his twiceweekly 25minute workout on the machine during his regular therapy session at the suites at holly creek a retirement community and assistedliving facility in centennial where he spent several weeks before returning to his practice he was assisted by jennifer lo holly creeks director of rehabilitation at 25000 the alterg is expensive but the technology is simple compressed air is pumped into a plastic chamber over the treadmill creating lift the patient is sealed from the waist down inside the chamber and a computer panel allows patients to take up to 80 percent of their body weight off their joints so a 200pound man can wind up effectively feeling like he weighs only 40 pounds a real boon when youre trying to rehab shattered shins as moore is gearing up at first glance moore looked like he was gearing up for a deepsea dive step 1 was getting into a pair of neoprene shorts topped with a stiff reinforced fabric that encircled his waist this ring contained a zipper that when moore stepped onto the treadmill was attached to another zipper forming a seal air was pumped in and lo programmed the alterg to let moore walk at 68 percent of his 205pound body weight his legs were effectively supporting a 139pound man moore who still limps badly 9 12 months after the accident started walking with alacrity no trace of hobbling at all the thing about this machine is that when patients get in here and offload their weight by 30 or 40 percent they can resume their normal gait lo said and theyre not just working their legs theyre getting a cardio workout too as moore walked on the treadmill he marveled at what it allows him to do im walking as fast as i did before the accident said moore 66 im walking as normal as i did a year ago when his session ended the machines whirring stopped and the plastic bubble encasing his lower body deflated moore stepped onto the carpeted floor and took a few halting steps toward the leg brace he wears now here i am back in real life he said there are

fake,london reuters a protein in urine could be a strong indicator of prostate cancer risk according to british scientists who say their findings could one day be developed into a quick and simple test for the disease medical equipment sits in labelled bins inside of a doctors office in new york in this march 17 2010 file photo reuterslucas jackson scientists from the cancer research uk cambridge research institute and the institute of cancer research icr said the protein called microseminoproteinbeta or msmb is found at reduced levels in men diagnosed with the disease and are also lower in men with more aggressive forms of the cancer the protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease said hayley whitaker of the cambridge institute who led the study whitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors prostate cancer killed an estimated 258000 men around the world in 2008 and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the united states in britain around 35000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10000 die from the disease the most effective screening tests currently available are based on a single biomarker called prostate specific antigen psa but psa testing is problematic because it has low specificity which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment a us study published last year found that routine psa prostate screening has resulted in more than one million american men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them at the moment psa testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as msmb that could be used in screening and diagnosis said rosalind eeles of the icr and the royal marsden hospital who also worked on the study the protein which regulates prostate cell death is produced by normal prostate cells the scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test msmb levels the results published in the public library of science plos one journal showed that msmb is found at significantly lower levels in the urine of men diagnosed with prostate cancer than those without the disease they also showed men with aggressive tumors were also likely to have lower levels of the protein in their urine commenting on the study kate holmes of the uks prostate cancer charity said they could prove very valuable in future given the known limitations of the psa blood test finding a technique to accurately diagnose prostate cancer is the holy grail of research into the disease she said in a statement an accurate reliable urine test for prostate cancer would be an invaluable tool if it is proven to be successful on a large scale protein urine test may signal prostate cancer
fake,bostonchicago reuters in september 2007 verna schrombeck gathered three of her six children those who could bear it to discuss her funeral arrangements she had been given just months to live and was about to undergo a lastditch cuttingedge heart surgery there was no guarantee she would return home geri norris poses for a portrait holding the rechargeable batteries for her heartmate ii left ventricular assist system at her home in marlborough massachusetts september 21 2010 the device implanted inside the patients chest and powered by external rechargable batteries connected by a cable coming out of the patients side pumps blood through the circulatory system on a continuous basis taking over most of the hearts work reutersbrian snyder had she organized things well enough she wondered so that her eldest son who was in charge of the estate would not be burdened had she taught her handicapped son an adult enough life skills to take care of himself she asked that the ave maria be played at her funeral a week later vernas sister drove her 8 hours from lowell indiana to rochester minnesota to the mayo clinic one of the countrys best hospitals for heart surgery her daughter flew in from kansas by the time verna arrived at the hospital she could barely walk to the admissions desk i leaned over the railing gasping for breath she said i told my daughter you have to get me a wheelchair verna now 78 was suffering from heart failure a progressive condition that in its advanced stages makes walking even a few feet difficult she had received multiple treatments including drugs and an implantable heart defibrillator but nothing was working in a final hail mary doctors decided to implant an experimental batterypowered mechanical heart pump known as a left ventricular assist device or lvad into a cavity in her abdomen to assist her heart in pumping by the time she returned home verna who received the device as part of a clinical trial was able to dispense with her oxygen tank and take on household chores three years later she is teaching piano to her five greatgrandchildren cooking meals for her family and driving by herself it has transformed me she said the device called heartmate ii and made by thoratec corp was approved by us health regulators in 2008 to keep patients alive while they waited for a heart transplant but in january it was approved for permanent use in patients who are ineligible for a transplant expanding the number of potential recipients from a few thousand to tens of thousands and potentially changing the landscape for the treatment of endstage heart failure there has been a tenfold increase in the use of these devices since they were approved for permanent use said dr lynne warner stevenson professor of medicine at harvard medical school and director cardiomyopathy and heart failure at brigham and womens hospital in boston we are going to know a lot more a year from now but my anticipation is that it will have been the approval of this device in january that will have really set the field in motion to survive patients must be connected to a lead called a driveline that runs from the lvad out through the skin and to a power source at night the driveline is plugged into a base unit with a display screen that provides statistical data which in turn is plugged into a wall socket by day patients are powered by a set of rechargeable batteries weighing six or seven pounds that can be carried around in a bag holster or vest the batteries are connected to a controller the size of a paperback book that can be worn on a belt around the waist we like to say im bionic said geri norris 63 a native of bristol england who now lives with her husband in marlborough massachusetts she is one of the new crop of patients who will live with the device indefinitely one big drawback she jokes is not being able to wear the clothes she likes this is not exactly a fashion statement she said ruefully plucking at the lightblue ll bean fishing vest that carries her equipment while powered by battery patients can go about much of their daily lives but being plugged into the wall at night albeit with a cord long enough for a trip to the bathroom takes some getting used to you know how they tether dogs to a clothes line said norris with a laugh thats what it feels like an unnatural death the rise in use of mechanical heart devices represents a dramatic leap forward in the treatment of heart failure but it also raises some potentially troubling ethical questions these machines have the capacity to extend life beyond its natural cycle and beyond what might be desirable this is one of the ways our technology has moved ahead of our humanity said stevenson we havent had enough experience yet about how to help people die naturally who have a ventricular assist device and i can tell you it is difficult to die with one of these things in place the body does not give up easily when the blood flow is maintained not that patients dont die infections are a fairly common cause of death as are bleeding and stroke but death may not always come naturally and decisions must be made about turning the device off we have to address what is the meaning of death on one of these pumps said dr valluvan jeevanandam chief of cardiac and thoracic surgery at the university of chicago medical center and an investigator for thoratecs clinical trials roughly 70 percent of patients on the heartmate ii were alive after a year and nearly 60 percent were alive after two years according to the latest data its not hard to imagine a person who has had severe stroke that has impacted both sides of the brain the kidneys are shutting down he is on a respirator but yet the lvad just keeps churning along said martin smith a clinical ethicist at the cleveland clinic under us law patients are allowed to ask that implanted devices be turned off but dr diane meier a professor in the department of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the mount sinai school of medicine said cardiologists are particularly bad at preparing patients for death especially this kind of death the number of consults that the palliative team gets from cardiologists can be measured on one hand she said we are called upon much more frequently by physicians in other disciplines holy grail still lvads are improving the quality of life for hundreds of patients including dick cheney the former vice president of the united states and a multiple heart attack survivor moreover the importance of lvad technology goes beyond its impact on existing patients it provides a platform for research into stem cell and other therapies designed to regenerate a patients own heart the holy grail is for a sick patient to get a pump which immediately helps said dr randall starling head of heart failure and cardiac transplant medicine at the cleveland clinic then we inject his own stem cells maybe in one shot or over the course of a year then he improves and his heart recovers and then he has the pump removed lvads have made regenerative therapy research the new science that uses stem cells to generate new organs and tissue much easier since the risk of hurting a patient is minimal the lvad carries out the hearts main pumping function no matter what research is conducted on the patients own heart once the patient undergoes a transplant the treated native heart with its cells and its genes can be examined and studied in five years we will have some fairly substantial number of patients treated and followed for a couple of years said dr leslie w miller director of the university of south floridas cardiovascular clinical and research integrated strategic program these advances may never materialize or they could be years down the road even so early data have proved promising and young patients who are scheduled to receive a transplant might consider postponing the procedure which is irreversible miller said maybe a mechanical pump is a better five to 10 year solution for these people because we hope to be in a better place by that time with stem cell technology and other regenerative models he said transplant survival at one year is 85 to 88 percent and 60 to 65 percent at five years and i think we can have these kind of figures with these devices crazy robotic heart daniel roth who just turned 23 is one of the young people faced with such a decision since receiving his lvad a year and a half ago he has lived an active life he works in a hospital exercises and plays in a rock band teamwork he is determined to get a transplant i could wait five years and hope stem cell therapy will work but by then im nearly 30 and i have things i want to do he said i want to be a musician and go on tour i would sacrifice some years off the end of my life not too many for the years left to be as awesome as they can be roth says he has been told transplant patients can expect to live 20 to 25 years but dr mark slaughter professor and chief of the division of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the university of louisville is not so sanguine the survival rate at one year is more than 80 percent he said but after that there is a 4 percent decline every year so that in 20 years everyone is dead you have a very finite timeline roth who lives with his parents in norwood massachusetts became ill in late 2006 with stomach pains and shortness of breath while studying marine biology at roger williams university in rhode island in january 2007 he had a stroke he was diagnosed with an enlarged heart and placed on the list for a transplant for the next two years he returned repeatedly to the hospital with symptoms such as vomiting fluid retention and shortness of breath a defibrillator was implanted i became very depressed and docile said roth who these days brims with optimism and energy playing in my band took every last ounce of strength he struggled on with medications but in early 2009 he caught a stomach bug that he could not shake he returned to the hospital while there his heart stopped he coded for about six minutes said his mother ellen tearfully emergency workers revived him but by that time he was too ill for transplant surgery even if he had been physically fitter there is no guarantee a donor heart would have been available it is estimated that some 50000 people around the world are candidates for heart transplant but only 5000 patients per year get them the only option for me was this crazy robotic heart he said it was implanted in april 2009 that summer was amazing he said i traveled with my band i did everything i didnt realize how sick i was until i got this thing now he is eligible once again for a transplant and he wants one he wants to be free of the encumbrances of the lvad the endless changing of the batteries the fear that the wiring might crap out that a power outage might hit he remembers vividly a fourth of july weekend away with friends in maine a fuse in the old house they were staying in blew and cut all power it was like a bad movie where the clock starts ticking on your life he said a flurry of calls to doctors and nearby hospitals led him to maine medical center in portland which had an extra base unit but he fears that if he is on tour in a remote part of the country or overseas he may not be so lucky to get his heart transplant roth needs to manage his weight one of his biggest challenges since one of the criteria for matching a donor heart with a recipient is weight class a heart donated by a 150pound woman wont support a 280pound man im doing well now ive lost 25 pounds and after the transplant ill be an angel he said ebulliently expanding market in addition to regenerative medicine coming down the pike new generations of lvads are also in development the heartmate ii is a thirdgeneration device and a vast improvement over its predecessor the heartmate xve which was so large it could not be used in small women and noisy enough to be disconcerting both to the patient and those around him dan mooney who had a long history of heart attacks and had several bypass surgeries by the time he was 53 received a prior generation lvad in early 2002 shortly after 911 and survived on it for about 14 months according to his widow cathy but people found him scary he would get into an elevator with his fishing vest and all these wires coming out and he was ticking she said in public he scared people half to death the heartmate ii by contrast is quiet it pumps blood on a continuous basis which eliminates the pulse currently the heartmate ii dominates the market but a rival company heartware international inc of framingham massachusetts is developing a smaller device that some experts believe could if approved as expected by early 2012 gain significant market share and possibly eclipse the heartmate ii i think the market overall is going to be very substantial but i do think that ultimately heartware has a better product so if thats the case why not try and bet on the best in class technology said kris jenner a portfolio manager at trowe price healthcare sciences fund jenner expects the market for ventricular assist devices to be worth as much as 1 billion in five years time still heartware ceo douglas godshall is cautious about building expectations too high we have certain advantages over thoratec our device is smaller and can be placed in the chest rather than a pocket in the abdomen which physicians like and its a faster procedure he said but it is not an insignificant advantage to already have approval and be on the market and have had a chance to work out a lot of your kinks we are just finding out what our kinks are larry feinberg who runs oracle investment management and holds shares in thoratec said he believes both companies will be winners over the long term i dont think there will be one dominant player and the other falls by the wayside he said i see it more as being a pretty close horse race with each technological advance causing each to leapfrog the other there are very high expectations for heartware if their data isnt perfect the stock could get really slammed results of heartwares pivotal advance bridgetotransplant trial will be presented at this years annual american heart association meeting in november and both physicians and wall street analysts expect positive results estimates vary as to the ultimate number of people who could benefit from the device with some predicting 30000 and others more than 100000 how far the market expands will likely depend on whether the device is used to treat patients at an earlier stage of their disease in the hope of staving off a worsening of symptoms stevenson the harvard professor said there is a spirited debate occurring in the medical community about the merits of this risks that seem very reasonable for somebody who has a miserable quality of life at home may be less reasonable if we have somebody who doesnt feel all that bad at home said stevenson we dont really have much data at all beyond two years and were already finding some surprises that are not such happy news in particular she said physicians are finding that there is more bleeding and a different kind of bleeding much of it in the colon stomach and nose than seen with thoratecs earlier device the heartmate xve right now were all waiting to see how much more thats going to be she said thoratec chief executive gary burbach said the company is studying the problem which appears with the continuous flow pump technology and is thought to somehow cause a disruption in the complex blood clotting process thoratec will continue to develop its pumps based on the current technology he said and doctors can manage the bleeding with medication breaking free from the wire experts agree that there will be an advantage to whichever company can dispense with the external driveline so that the entire system including batteries and controller are beneath the skin and power is transmitted across the skin im a believer that the percutaneous driveline ultimately needs to go away said slaughter the university of louisville professor who is coprincipal investigator on heartwares bridgetotransplant trial totally implantable lvad technology known as transcutaneous energy transmission systems tets are not new but before being clinically useful the technology and battery life need to be improved said slaughter if you wanted a tet system from which you could disconnect for 15 to 20 minutes a day you could have one in six months he said that might give a patient the chance to jump in a shower but probably would not be worth the more complicated surgery if a patient could be disconnected for two hours a day enough to swim relax in a hot tub or be intimate with a partner that could significantly increase their quality of life if you want to be disconnected for one hour twice a day i think that could be doable within the next two years slaughter said slideshow 11 images thoratec has its sights set on developing a totally implantable device with no driveline and longerrunning batteries within five years burbach said it is still unclear how long the devices will keep patients alive experts say they could last as long as 10 years verna

call for new clinical trials to test hiv drugs in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome doctors dont know what causes chronic fatigue syndrome characterized by debilitating fatigue and chronic pain with symptoms that can wax and wane over time some patients say friends coworkers and even family members dont believe they are really sick studies finding a viral connection with the disease would completely transform how the illness is treated and viewed the findings also offer a potential path for treatment possibly with drugs that are already fdaapproved for another condition based on other recent research linking the syndrome to a retrovirus called xmrv some doctors are already prescribing drugs approved for hiv for fatigue patients the syndrome has no effective treatments yet the group of viruses identified in fatigue patients called murine leukemia virusrelated viruses or mlv are known to cause cancer and neurological problems in mice but whether they cause disease in humans isnt

patients with chronic fatigue syndrome compared with just three of 44 or 68 of apparently healthy blood donors mondays paper is the latest in a series of reports about a possible link between cfs and a virus interest in viruses has been intense since an october report in the journal science found xmrv in a majority of fatigue patients subsequent studies have focused on xmrv and found conflicting evidence indeed the justpublished study was held back from publication in june because it was at odds with a report from the centers for disease control and prevention which found no evidence of xmrv in chronicfatiguesyndrome patients related slideshow << the current paper didnt find xmrv eitherone reason it isnt likely to resolve a brewing debate over the role xmrv may play in the syndrome but researchers said the variants of mlvlike viruses closely related to xmrv that they found in fatigue patients was evidence of a link between the virus family and the syndrome andrew mason a university of alberta professor cowrote the commentary in the journal calling for trials testing antiretrovirals in cfs patients who are positive for one of the mlvrelated viruses if the patients improve after a certain point you stop debating whether it causes the disease and say the treatment works and were going to use it said dr mason but until scientists develop further evidence establishing that the virus causes the syndrome a largescale clinical trial testing hiv drugs against the ailment isnt likely norbert bischofberger chief scientific officer at gilead sciences inc gild 136 the leading maker of hiv drugs said the company might consider a small pilot trial but would like to see stronger evidence that the viruses cause cfs before launching a large trial still im very open and this would be a great opportunity he said a spokesman for merck mrk 059 co another major manufacturer of hiv drugs said a clinical trial program would be possible to develop only after further substantial evidence of an association with cfs some doctors and patients are already testing the idea based in part on a university of utah and emory university study in cells the compounds were tested singly and then in combinations of two at a time and suggested that three antiretroviral drugs appeared to inhibit infection by xmrv jamie deckoffjones 56 years old a doctor and cfs patient in new mexico has been blogging about her experiences and those of her 20yearold daughter both tested positive for xmrv and are taking a combination of three antiretrovirals dr deckoffjones said a year ago she could only get up for short periods during the day after five months on the drugs she flew last week to reno for an xmrv conference her daughter was able to go to a party and is enrolling in community college this is all very new and there is no way to know if improvement will continue dr deckoffjones wrote in an email but we appear to be on an uphill course after the latest paper was held the researchers took additional steps to demonstrate that the finding was related to a retrovirus and not lab contamination eight of the fatigue patients in the study who tested positive for an mlvrelated virus using blood frozen 15 years ago were asked to come back to give fresh blood seven of the eight remained positive and the virus had changed slightly over time a characteristic of a retrovirus many questions remain on why different groups are coming up with different results it is still unclear why the centers for disease control didnt find xmrv or mlvrelated viruses in its own study of fatigue patients at a press briefing monday steve monroe director of cdcs division of highconsequence pathogens and pathology said that cdc was able to find mlvrelated viruses in a small number of prostate cancer patients data that isnt yet published anthony l komaroff of harvard medical school an author of the latest study said one explanation may be that the patients used in the new study were chosen because they were very sick patients in other studies are a very different group of people than the ones that knock on my door he said meantime the finding that a small fraction of healthy blood donors may be harboring mlvlike virus raises new worries researchers said if confirmed and shown to reflect the presence of the virus in the broader population it could mean that tens of millions of people in the us and more worldwide are infected the implications arent clear research has also linked xmrv to prostate cancer people diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are already barred from donating blood in canada australia and new zealand out of fear a virus may be passed on through transfusions aabb a bethesda md organization whose members collect most blood donated in the us advises that americans with fatigue syndrome not donate blood until more data are available a federally led working group is trying to determine how many blood donors may be infected write to amy dockser marcus at amymarcus

fake,surgeon daniel eun aligns the camera of a robotic da vinci surgical system before a procedure at pennsylvania hospital the technology eun says offers vast benefits in visualization merging your naked eye with a camera that has magnification as joe lessman readied his accounting business for the start of tax season last year he agonized over his doctors recommendation that he have open surgery to remove a cancerous prostate were coming into my busy season and i just cant be on my back for six to eight weeks he told his physician ill be out of business so lessman 49 sought care instead at pennsylvania hospital where a robotic device assists in some surgeries the radical robotic prostatectomy performed one wednesday in january cleared his earlystage cancer lessman was back home in mantua that friday off his pain medication by saturday and back to working 16hour days at his gloucester county business by monday my clients didnt miss a beat he said i was very fortunate lessman is one of hundreds of thousands of patients across the country to undergo robotic surgery in recent years since the first device was approved by the us food and drug administration in 1999 robotic surgery has grown rapidly and is now used in dozens of procedures among the most common are removal of the gall bladder uterus hysterectomy prostate kidney and uterine fibroids as well as gastric bypass and mitralvalve repair in traditional surgery the patient is cut open and doctors use their eyes and sometimes magnifying devices to see and their hands to operate laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery was a major advance because it could be done with a small incision a laparoscope and surgical instruments were inserted and the image on a monitor allowed the doctors to control the instruments in their hands from outside the body in laparoscopic robotic surgery the surgeon is farther removed from the patient a 3d camera and machineheld surgical instruments are inserted through small incisions the surgeon operates while seated at a console nearby there the doctor peering into a monitor that displays a threedimensional image manipulates the instruments and camera using hand controls and foot pedals proponents say this leads to lessinvasive and moreaccurate surgery but that does not necessarily mean outcomes are better some doctors say more research is needed to prove that certain robotic procedures are superior to other operations recent reports of problematic robotic surgeries have also led to concern about whether all doctors who use the devices have been sufficiently trained and as with other types of hightech equipment that hospitals market aggressively to attract patients who could go elsewhere the proliferation of robotic systems can mean fewer procedures being done at each institution a potential problem when higher volume is related to better outcomes in general patients should seek out surgeons who have done more cases because they tend to have better results experts say more than 1000 da vinci surgical systems the preeminent robotic technology in the united states have been installed across the country about 20 of them in the philadelphia area the number of surgeries performed using da vinci rose 51 percent in just one year to 200000 in 2009 theres no question that robotic surgery is a big advance said howard saul a gynecological oncologist at the center for cancer and hematologic disease in cherry hill its not going to be a flash in the pan saul is affiliated with the lourdes health system where 410 robotic surgeries were done last year such sophistication comes with a hefty price tag at an average of 14 million the da vinci system represents a major purchase for many hospitals for patients and insurance companies there is no significant cost difference between robotic surgery and other operations although some insurers may pay hospitals less for shorter inpatient stays said vipul patel founder of the society of robotic surgery and medical director of the global robotics institute in florida so hospitals and surgeons bear the burden of making the robot financially viable said patel a urologist a hospital that buys a robot and rarely uses it is likely to lose money he said but with efficient highly skilled surgeons hospitals can reap financial benefits robotics are expensive patel said but depending on how theyre used they can make things cheaper for instance surgeons say patients who have robotic operations are discharged from the hospital more quickly are less likely to require blood transfusions and need less pain medication all cost savers the smaller incisions created during robotic procedures typically result in less blood loss and less pain than open surgery they say robotic surgery may offer other benefits it represents a vast improvement in visualization said daniel eun the pennsylvania hospital surgeon who operated on lessman in january it becomes a merging of what youd see with your naked eye with the enhanced visualization of a camera that has magnification said eun the hospitals director of minimally invasive and robotic urologic oncology and reconstruction surgeons at the university of pennsylvania health system which includes pennsylvania hospital did 1109 robotic procedures last year instead of the chopsticks used in laparoscopy robotic surgery equipment allows for more natural movements including wrist function said saul the oncologist in cherry hill it has more degrees of freedom than your own hand he said youre able to get into places where your hand cant go and in sauls practice robotic operations have presented another option for complex patients such as the elderly and obese weve operated on people that have had five prior

shostakovichs prelude and fugue no 15 so she went back a few measures to redeem herself only to get stuck in the same spot very upset she thanked the panel and walked out a year later after getting into northwestern universitys bienen school of music as a graduate student she was introduced to a little orange pill that she says helped launch her professional career while betablockers have long been known as effective treatments for heart failure many conservatory students and professional classical musicians use these drugs to relieve performance anxiety induced by their highly competitive and noroomforerror line of work at the curtis institute of music in philadelphia professor hal robinson praises betablockers as a great mechanism for anxiety relief and has no problems with students using them but another professor joseph silverstein compares them to legalized steroids for the classically trained betablockers are at the center of a growing debate about the use of prescription drugs to enhance performance an estimated 20 percent of american high schoolers told interviewers for the 2009 national youth risk behavior survey that they were taking the drugs for nonmedical uses betablockers along with the stimulant ritalin and some medicines for parkinsons disease are now considered smart drugs because some people believe they can boost alertness and improve test performance for high school and college students a 1991 study investigated betablockers effectiveness on sat performance for 32 students who had test anxiety when given betablockers an hour before taking the sat for the second time the study found the students scored an average 130 points higher than their drugfree first round the normal increase would be about 30 points out of 1600 total the paper said betablockers have stirred up controversy in the sports world the world antidoping agency listed them as a performance enhancer in 1999 and currently bans their use in 18 sports from billiards to archery in the first major doping scandal of the 2008 beijing olympics north korean pistol shooter kim jongsu was stripped of his silver and bronze medals after testing positive for the betablocker propranolol and last spring swedish wheelchair curler glenn ikonen was suspended for taking metoprolol at the 2010 paralympics in vancouver golfers have been rumored to use betablockers to sharpen their focus and precision for putting the pga tour banned betablocker usage in 2008 because it decreases tremors and steadies nerves which could give a competitive advantage says spokeswoman ana leaird musicians say many students choose to use the drugs more to calm themselves than intensify their playing betablockers are not performance enhancers at least not for musicians says curtis student jessica t chang who says she has never used betablockers but is now considering them after a shaky debut performance last year either you can play or not the violist says it just helps the anxiety go away kontorovitch who says she has been diagnosed for performance anxiety has been taking betablockers occasionally for nine years and no longer performs without them though she has been playing piano since she was 5 the 35yearold vocal accompanist at the bienen school in evanston ill still gets stage fright it can be two people or 500 people i become extremely anxious she says its like an impending doom over my head the thought of not being able to go back and fix mistakes makes me lose it betablockers were created to reduce heart rate and blood pressure in patients who survived heart attacks or are at risk for cardiovascular problems since the food and drug administration approved the first betablockers in the late 1960s theyve been the most commonly prescribed drugs for heart failure and hypertension accounting for 18 billion in us sales in 2009 according to ims health a healthcare information company they are sold under many names metoprolol lopressor toprolxl propranolol inderal and atenolol tenormin among others the drugs were designed to keep specific proteins from binding to adrenaline the combination activates the bodys fightorflight response causing increases in heart rate blood pressure and uncontrolled reflexes though people have shortterm side effects such as lowered blood pressure from using the drugs no catastrophic events have been reported still research has not looked at longterm effects of use in healthy individuals and the drugs can cause problems for those who use them for nonmedical purposes at johns hopkins university cardiologist lili barouch recalled seeing a fellow doctor pass out while giving a speech because he had taken a betablocker for stage fright barouch warns that improper use can lead to dizziness and lightheadedness from a drop in blood pressure as well as wheezing for those with asthma please consult your doctor before taking this medication she advises some music students do get their family doctors to write scrips for betablockers to help with anxiety but sharing is also common cellist liz zook admits to getting a betablocker from her friend before a final exam this past spring i didnt shake nearly as much with it says the temple university undergraduate she says she would take a pill again before a stressful performance its easy enough to find one if i need it she says kontorovitch too was introduced to betablockers by a friend after experiencing its calming effect she says she got a prescription some musicians worry that experimenting with betablockers could make them dependent on the drugs but anjan chatterjee a neurologist at the university of pennsylvania says betablockers are usually not addictive he speculates that its the musicians psyche that makes them believe that they need it this is why curtis violin professor joseph silverstein strongly opposes betablocker use for anxiety adrenaline is increased under the strain of performances and we have to deal with it says silverstein a former concertmaster for the boston symphony orchestra silverstein has used betablockers after a mild heart attack 13 years ago i had my doctor take me off of them immediately he says recalling that he had experienced dumbeddown moments during rehearsals and concerts while on the drugs students ask about them and i tell them no he says i dont believe in meddling with your natural biorhythms which is such an important aspect of our lives as musicians colleague hal robinson begs to differ though he says he has never used a betablocker the former national symphony orchestra bass player believes that certain musicians will never play up to their full potential without it musicians are under lots of pressure to land slots in highly competitive orchestras robinson says and physical responses to stress can hinder some peoples ability to perform kurt hansen a faculty member at the bienen school says that an exceptionally talented friend of his gave up performing because of her inability to conquer stage fright in 1964 before betablockers she would be a complete basket case says the renowned tenor who says he has never used the drug himself ive always wondered if betablockers could have helped her she had such a beautiful voice while some adrenaline can be helpful too much can be debilitating chatterjee says both robinson and hansen believe betablockers are worth taking for performance anxiety many call them performance enhancers i call them performance enablers robinson says he estimates that close to a third of his students are currently taking betablockers with his blessings as the classical music world becomes ever more competitive many students are trying to keep up with the joneses or in this case the yoyo mas i think i would have done so much better with my career if i knew about betablockers when i was in school kontorovitch says betablockers used by musicians athletes students to enhance performance

fake,by amanda gardner healthday reporter wednesday july 28 2010 healthday news drinking alcohol may help keep rheumatoid arthritis at bay possibly because it dampens the bodys immune response new research suggests alcohol consumption may also protect people who already have the autoimmune disease from developing a more debilitating form this actually isnt a new concept there have been other articles stating that alcohol might be protective said dr guy fiocco assistant professor of internal medicine at texas am health science center college of medicine and director of rheumatology at scott white in temple texas but i dont think were going to be advocating alcohol to prevent rheumatoid arthritis nor do the study authors advise drinking as a cure for arthritis we would wish to point out that at the moment that our findings are preliminary and would not recommend that patients drink alcohol with the specific purpose of treating their arthritis said dr james maxwell lead author of the study and a consultant rheumatologist at the rotherham nhs foundation trust in england we would also remind patients to observe recommended government limits for alcohol consumption he added according to background information in the study published online july 28 in rheumatology previous studies were mostly conducted in mice the benefit of ethanol exposure for these rodents seemed to be due to higher levels of testosterone the researchers wrote for this study the authors compared 1004 healthy participants to 873 people with rheumatoid arthritis both of those groups were divided into four groups nondrinkers those who drank 1 to 5 days a month the ones who drank 6 to 10 days a month and those who drank more frequently we found that arthritis was progressively less severe as alcohol frequency increased with a definite difference compared to nondrinkers even in the least frequent alcohol consumption group maxwell said the teetotalers had quadruple the risk of having rheumatoid arthritis compared with those who drank in the highest category and the more often one drank the less damaging the rheumatoid arthritis tended to be including healthier joints as shown on xrays and less inflammation the association was seen in both men and women though it was stronger in males although no one can pinpoint a reason for the link with certainty essentially we think that alcohol may be having an effect by reducing the immune response which leads to joint inflammation and also that it may have a mild painkilling effect said maxwell theres a little information that alcohol can suppress the immune system added fiocco whats been reported is that people who drink excessive alcohol actually have higher levels of the cytokines that lead to the inflammation and moderate amounts of alcohol actually may lower these levels this finding is slightly different than what is reported in the current study that the severity of the disease decreased with more alcohol because the researchers assessed drinking frequency rather than the amount of alcohol consumed it is not clear how much alcohol might be helpful they said and maxwell stressed that their preliminary findings need to be replicated in the future there are limitations to any research which asks patients to report their exposure to something such as alcohol over a period of time maxwell added we would therefore recommend that a future prospective study should be performed to further assess the impact of alcohol consumption on rheumatoid arthritis a study recording alcohol consumption at the time rather than asking about it later more information the us national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases has more on rheumatoid arthritis could drinking help thwart rheumatoid arthritis

who have good support from spouses and significant others source marilyn ritholz a senior psychologist at joslin diabetes center type 1 diabetes affects every aspect of life type 1 diabetes affects every aspect of life type 1 diabetes is not one of those medical conditions for which you can just pop a pill and then forget about it it forces you to think about every bite you put in your mouth every activity you do says andrew drexler director of the gonda diabetes center at ucla its always there you can never get away from it there are almost 24 million estimated cases of diabetes according to the american diabetes association almost 10 of diagnosed cases are type 1 experts believe the disease involves an autoimmune process that destroys insulinproducing cells in the pancreas insulin is a hormone needed to convert sugar starches and other food into energy we know theres a genetic component but not everybody with that genetic component gets type 1 drexler says type 1 is usually diagnosed in children and young adults the most serious shortterm problem is hypoglycemia or low blood sugar which can cause wooziness and disorientation if it strikes while someones driving for instance hes at risk for an accident if blood sugar dips severely low coma and death can occur untreated hyperglycemia when blood sugar runs too high can lead to longterm problems over the years including kidney disease blindness and limb amputation a diagnosis can have a significant effect on mental health says duke endocrinologist susan spratt patients go through the stages of grief spratt says they mourn the life they had before diabetes a life when they could eat exercise and sleep spontaneously spratt says the key to managing the disease check blood sugar often and use insulin and other medicines to keep blood sugars steady drexler says are we close to finding a cure we likely wont see any major breakthroughs soon in the next 10 years drexler says but spratt says patients should remain positive we have to give our patients hope that the medical community is working on a cure type 1 diabetes is treatable you can live a full life and grow up have a family and be anything you want to be by mary brophy marcus usa today orlando scientists are getting closer to offering an artificial pancreas to children and adults with type 1 diabetes that will help better control the swings of blood glucose that come with the disease researchers working on artificial pancreas technology announced at this weekends 70th scientific sessions of the american diabetes association that the latest tests of the technology show it can be used in reallife scenarios with success including after eating a large meal and drinking a glass of white wine the rubber is finally starting to hit the road were seeing more and more studies telling us it can be done and it can be done safely says aaron kowalski research director of the artificial pancreas project for the juvenile diabetes research foundation kowalski says they believe the technology could be available within the next few years artificial pancreas technology has three components a continuous glucose monitor attached by a slender wire to the body that measures blood glucose levels and the direction they are trending through the day as opposed to pricking the finger and using test strips to get a single snapshot blood sugar reading an insulin pump also attached to the body that doses insulin continuously at a low level and can be adjusted a sophisticated computer program that can help the two devices talk to each other and automate the process the first two technologies are already available researchers with the juvenile diabetes research foundation have been testing the multicomponent system in a range of inclinic situations earlier this year in a study in thelancet they showed that the artificial pancreas technology could better control blood glucose levels during sleep and reduce the chance of hypoglycemia or dangerously low blood sugar in children with type 1 in this weekends presentation researchers reported that the benefits remained when the system was tested in 12 adults ages 18 to 65 who ate a large meal and drank a glass of white wine before bedtime it was quite a large meal a meal like youd eat out at a restaurant with a glass of wine it included over 100 grams of carbohydrates says lead researcher roman hovorka principal research associate at the university of cambridge metabolic research laboratories in the study 70 of the time participants were within their target blood glucose range up from 47 when they didnt use the technology even with this technology youre still working backward says endocrinologist robert rizza executive dean of research at the mayo clinic it takes time for that insulin to be absorbed despite that fact its been working very well and helps avoid very high and very low blood sugars guidelines you share in the usa today community so please

fake,en espaol by steven reinberg healthday reporter sunday june 27 2010 healthday news new research suggests that artificial pancreas technology can help diabetics gain greater blood sugar control overnight even when they have eaten a big meal or had wine for dinner the promise of this emerging technology is to free diabetics from the need to constantly monitor their blood sugar levels by letting a computer program do the job constantly adjusting glucose and insulin levels as needed using this technology is still seen as a stopgap however while a biological solution to diabetes is sought we have pioneered the development of a closedloop artificial pancreas because we believe it will significantly impact the lives of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes by providing exquisite control of blood sugar dr richard a insel executive vice president for research at the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf said during a noon teleconference saturday a symposium on advances in the technology cosponsored by the american diabetes association and the jdrf is slated for sunday as part of the american diabetes associations annual meeting in orlando fla for people with type 1 diabetes controlling their blood sugar levels is a fulltime job too much insulin can cause low blood sugar hypoglycemia which can be lifethreatening while too little causes the serious damage of diabetes such as kidney vision and circulation problems the promise in the near term of these technologies is not only to help us reduce significantly the risk of longterm diabetic complications but also to reduce the risk of having a catastrophic hypoglycemic event and further help people with diabetes live easier aaron kowalski research director of the jdrfs artificial pancreas project said during the teleconference this will help keep people healthy while we drive toward a biological approach which will take longer he said in the first report dr roman hovorka a principal research associate in the department of pediatrics at the university of cambridge reported that the technology can significantly improve overnight blood sugar control in adults without the fear of developing hypoglycemia with the technology patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for 70 percent of the time compared to 47 percent of the time among those not using the technology moreover glucose control was demonstrated in reallife situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine we let them consume about threequarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal hovorka said during saturdays teleconference what has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning these results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels he added we reduced hypoglycemia by half he said our plan is to move into home studies which hopefully will happen later on this year hovorka said meanwhile marilyn ritholz a senior psychologist at the joslin diabetes center and an assistant professor of psychology at the harvard medical school reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring so far studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring cgm she said during the teleconference ritholzs team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control frustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device we found that the people who did well used a more problemsolving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the cgm she said people who were not successful used emotionbased coping ritholz said they easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up in addition successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or significant other she added all patients felt selfconscious wearing the device ritholz noted we know that cgm success or failure is as dependent on the human experience as it is on the perfection of the technology she said speaking at the saturday teleconference dr william tamborlane chief of pediatric endocrinology at yale university school of medicine and cochair of the juvenile diabetes research foundations continuous glucose monitoring group said the system only works if worn almost every day studies have shown that children and adults over 25 who used cgm were able to reduce their blood sugar levels however teenagers did not see a benefit probably because they were less likely to wear the device tamborlane said people who used the device more than six days per week saw improvement regardless of age he added to get more people to use cgm the industry needs to come up with better systems and better devices he said artificial pancreas technology combines cgm with an insulin pump and a sophisticated computer program that controls when and how much insulin to deliver the device delivers two hormones that are deficient in type 1 diabetes insulin which keeps blood sugar levels from going too high after a meal and glucagon a naturally occurring hormone that prevents blood sugar levels from dropping too low however the complicated computer algorithm for the pump system is still being developed more information for more information on type 1 diabetes visit the american diabetes association artificial pancreas continues to show promise
fake,london reuters iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far in advance the test which measures levels of a hormone produced by cells in the ovaries was able to predict the age at which women reached menopause to within an average of 4 months according to data to be presented at the conference of the european society of human reproduction and embryology in rome on monday the results could enable us to make a more realistic assessment of womens reproductive status many years before they reach menopause said ramezani tehrani of the shahid beheshti university of medical sciences in tehran who led the study experts commenting on the work agreed it was promising but said its findings would need to be confirmed in larger trials the possibility of an accurate predictor for menopause is very exciting people have been looking for something like this for years said dagan wells of the nuffield department of obstetrics and gynaecology at oxford university the average age for menopause is 51 with ovulation in most women ending sometime between age 40 and 60 but it can happen later or earlier making it difficult for women who want to develop a career before having babies to know how long to wait tehranis team took blood samples from 266 women aged between 20 and 49 who were also taking part in another study called the tehran lipid and glucose study which started in 1998 they then measured concentrations of a hormone called the antimullerian hormone amh that is produced by cells in womens ovaries amh controls the development of follicles in the ovaries from which eggs develop and the scientists suspected it might be useful for judging ovarian function statistical model the researchers took two more blood samples at three yearly intervals and also collected information on the womens socioeconomic background and reproductive history we developed a statistical model for estimating the age at menopause from a single measurement of amh concentration tehrani explained in a report on the study using this model we estimated mean average ages at menopause for women at different time points in their reproductive life span tehrani said the results showed a good level of agreement between predicted and actual age at menopause for the 63 women in the group who reached menopause during the study the average difference between the predicted age and the womens actual age at menopause was a third of a year and the maximum margin of error was three to four years wells said tehranis team appeared to have hit upon a fairly accurate algorithm for predicting menopause but said it would be important to see if the method could also help predict the time when fertility effectively ends a woman may cease monthly ovulation and experience menopause at 50 but she will probably have been effectively infertile for several years prior to this he said it will be important to let patients know that fertility will have declined greatly in the years preceding the final ovulation scientists find way to predict timing of menopause
fake,cnn losing interest in sex would be unfortunate for most people but for linda poelzl it was a professional hazard i just wasnt feeling much interest in sex and this was very disturbing to me says poelzl who lives and works in san francisco i have to have a certain amount of interest in it because of my work poelzls describes her work as a sex educator and coach helping men women and couples work through their sexual problems she says she usually possesses a great lust for lust but then her libido started dissipating a few years ago when she was in her late 40s shocked and not quite sure what to do she turned to medical doctors and found there wasnt much they could offer as theres no prescription medicine like viagra to help a woman when her sex life gets stuck the greatest hope for a socalled female viagra was a drug called flibanserin but it was nixed by a panel of food and drug administration experts on friday who said the drug didnt seem to really help women with sexual dysfunction this was the second time a socalled female viagra failed to make it on the market in 2004 an fda panel said no to intrinsa a testosterone patch meant to hormonally help women with a lack of desire for sex given these two rejections it could be a while before another pharmaceutical company decides to sink money into developing a new drug for women with sexual problems one company biosante pharmaceuticals hopes to bring a testosterone gel to the market in 2012 but there arent many other products on the horizon there hasnt been much action in this area and that certainly has to come up when a company is thinking about dumping money into researching a drug for female sexual dysfunction says phyllis greenberger president of the society for womens health research which received money from boehringer ingelheim the company that makes flibanserin thats despite a seeming need for such medication in 2008 a survey of more than 30000 us women in the journal obstetrics gynecology found that nearly 40 percent reported that theyd had a sexual problem at some point in their lives most often a lack of desire after seeing medical doctors but getting few results poelzl decided to take another route she visited alternative practitioners and began experimenting with taoist exercises used in chinese medicine she practiced six minutes of exercises every morning such as sitting quietly in a chair massaging her lower abdomen while theres no hard science that shows that taoist practices will improve a womans sex life poelzl says it worked for her i noticed i started feeling more energy in my body and more libido she says but it took at least six weeks of almost daily practice you have to be committed in fact for nearly all alternative practices there are no largescale studies saying if they work or not but in the absence of a drug to help women with sexual problems heres whats recommended by some practitioners 1 acupuncture jill blakeway a licensed acupuncturist

fake,june 22 2010 drinking lots of coffee probably isnt entirely good for you but it does lower your risk of mouth and throat cancer thats probably not what university of milan researchers carlotta galeone scd phd and colleagues thought theyd find when they analyzed nine studies comparing 5139 people with head and neck cancer to 9028 people without cancer but the numbers came out this way people who drink more than four cups of coffee each day have 39 lower odds of getting mouth or throat cancer compared to people who dont drink coffee the protection was seen for oral and pharyngeal cancer but not for cancer of the larynx drinking less than five cups of coffee a day had a smaller but statistically significant protective effect about 4 lower odds of mouth and throat cancer for each cup drunk daily was it the caffeine probably not though there werent enough data on decaf drinkers to draw conclusions drinking tea even massive quantities was not protective galeone and colleagues note that coffee contains more than a thousand chemicals some such as cafestol and kahweol have anticancer properties but whether these substances actually protect against cancer in humans is a question for future studies most head and neck cancers are linked to alcohol consumption and to smoking interestingly the protective effect of coffee was not diminished in drinkers and smokers nor was the effect boosted by consumption of fruits and vegetables also shown to protect against head and neck cancers galeone and colleagues report their findings in the july issue of cancer epidemiology biomarkers prevention lots of coffee lowers oral cancer risk
fake,they are part of a new wave of smart implantable devices that is transforming the care of people with heart disease and creating a bonanza for researchers the hope is that the devices now being tested in clinical trials will save lives reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs patients who often are frail or live far from their doctors can be spared frequent office visits doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients hearts are starting to fail its like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week said dr leslie saxon a cardiologist at the university of southern california the big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range 20 or 30 feet that meant that with her device mrs elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest instead she simply went near a small box which is attached to a phone jack near her bed once a week she also measures her weight and blood pressure key indicators of heart failure and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor if there are problems the machine alerts her doctor now every single day the device is being queried said her doctor james coman of the heart rhythm institute in tulsa its just a phenomenal tool there is a downside though information overload is a very serious problem for the doctors said dr lynne warner stevenson director of the heart failure program at brigham and womens hospital in boston and a professor at harvard medical school who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices more information she warned is not always beneficial the devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear like variations in heart rate large swings in heart rate can indicate risk but it is not clear what to do about them even more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung impedance changes can predict future heart crises but more often have no clinical explanation yet when doctors get data on impedance changes they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are making patients uneasy in turn dr stevenson said advertisement continue reading the main story dr stevenson likened such information to the game of jeopardy doctors are given answers in search of a question its a challenge even for the nations 1000 heart failure specialists but it can be even harder for primary care doctors who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition dr richard page president of the heart rhythm society said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data still he said the new technology is potentially transformative for researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem how to analyze the data a large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1000 maybe 2000 patients now boston scientific a maker of one of the smart heart devices is following 400000 patients no one has ever done research like this before said dr saxon who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing boston scientific research the company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write dr saxon said boston scientific gets data from patients defibrillators it also gets information on deaths from medicare the data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed a task requiring the company to become more like a google or a microsoft handling enormous amounts of information there are for example more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60000 instances when the defibrillators went off shocking a patients heart so far dr saxons group has reported on the first 90000 patients half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group photo patients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices dr saxon reported and in a paper under review the group reports that their threeyear survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data advertisement continue reading the main story other researchers will be analyzing economic data the devices can cost as much as 30000 do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits a study using a similar device made by medtronic suggests that is the case the medtronic study directed by dr george crossley president of st thomas heart at baptist hospital in nashville involved 2000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit those with the nontransmitting

plausible reason we think is that we got to these people much sooner in the course of their illness dr crossley said we think we did not let the people in the remote sensing group get into heart failure still the information overload problem looms one solution being tested by st jude medical a medical device company in st paul is to let patients deal with important data the idea said dr neal eigler a senior vice president at st jude is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their hearts functioning just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings patients hold a small device over their chest twice a day and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath it transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium the upper left chamber of the heart if pressure in that chamber gets too high the lungs can fill with fluid doctors preprogram the handheld device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements telling them for example to take a different dose of a medication restrict fluid intake increase their activity level or call the clinic if successful the smart device could have a big effect one million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs advertisement continue reading the main story dr stevenson who has no connection with st jude is intrigued patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly they have to strictly limit salt in their diet for example and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating a patient might say maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza i had for dinner last night had a lot of salt dr stevenson said as a more positive incentive the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well st jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial in the pilot study the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by twothirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months meanwhile patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind they include people like danielle denlein who to her total shock developed a serious heart problemon october 20 2008 at 150 pm ms denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5dayold baby girl suddenly she felt a pain in her chest she thought it was heartburn then it began radiating down her arm i just knew i dont know how i knew but i knew i was having a heart attack she said although she was only 35 her main coronary artery had ripped open a rare complication associated with pregnancy advertisement continue reading the main story ms denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart and to alert her doctor dr saxon to problems if they occur its life changing ms denlein said it gives me such a feeling of comfort mrs elzo feels the same way had her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced she said i shudder to think what would have happened new devices to help heart patients

the legs the treatment known as sclerotherapy an alternative to surgery entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls so the vein eventually disappears a series of sessions is usually required for a large area vein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs one sodium tetradecyl sulfate or sts has long been fda approved the other polidocanol had not been legal although some doctors used it importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds you have some legal exposure by doing so said dr morrison a vein specialist in

polidocanol should benefit patients several ways often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were wrong and had lots of contaminants that could damage the skin where injected according to dr robert a weiss a baltimore dermatologist who directs the maryland laser skin and vein institute by contrast he said by email asclera is very safe for skin an injectors experience

a sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy but the fda considers a foam version of sts or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid so injecting it is an offlabel use dr min

candidate for replacement this year 4400 patients are expected to undergo surgery to replace arthritic or injured ankles with artificial joints made of metal alloys and lightweight plastic according to industry estimates four models are commonly used in the united states with food and drug administration approval and demand is expected to grow as more and more baby boomers hobble into their 60s and 70s with debilitating ankle pain ankle replacement has been around for three decades but it has been slow to catch on problems with early devices left surgeons and patients wary the operation is complex and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience while medicare pays for ankle replacement many private insurers do not each year about two million americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture an estimated 50000 people a year experience endstage ankle arthritis in which the ankle cartilage has worn away completely causing painful boneonbone contact and some level of disability until lately such patients have had only one surgical option ankle fusion surgery in which the wornout part of the joint is removed and the bones are permanently locked together with screws and plates the procedure usually relieves pain but the patient loses mobility in the ankle leading to changes in gait and ultimately additional wear and tear and arthritic pain in other parts of the ankle about 25000 ankle fusions were performed in the united states last year andrew keaveney now 73 shattered his ankle in a fall from a truck while hanging flags as an american legion volunteer surgery repaired the broken bones but he continued to have severe pain doctors suggested ankle fusion but he found a surgeon who offered total ankle replacement he had the operation in december 2008 and now he says the ankle is 99 percent before the surgery i couldnt sleep at night said mr keaveney of locust valley ny now im able to climb ladders i have absolutely no pain i was even playing soccer with my grandkids a few months ago his surgeon dr craig s radnay an associate at the insall scott kelly institute for orthopedics and sports medicine in new york city and on long island says he is now a big believer in ankle replacement for certain patients for an ankle replacement you have to be a little more picky in who you select for those cases he said but i cant tell you how many patients come in and i mention this option they dont even know exists dr radnay who says he has performed more than 100 ankle replacements using an inbone device from wright medical group of arlington tenn is now a paid consultant to the company helping to gather data on longterm success rates the ideal patient is around 60 years old and of normal weight although doctors consider older patients depending on their health people with diabetes may not be good candidates because they may risk complications as a result of poor blood circulation dr jonathan t deland chief of the foot and ankle service at the hospital for special surgery in manhattan said that while the devices had improved he remained cautious about offering the operation dr deland is helping to develop a new ankle replacement device for zimmer of warsaw ind which may be submitted for fda approval this year the big concern about ankle replacement is how often do they fail and how often do they loosen he said complications can include slow healing as well as infection severe complications are rare but they can result in amputation still dr deland said were getting fewer and fewer failures the new models require that less bone be removed so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger in addition instruments used to guide surgeons in aligning the artificial joint have improved dr deland cited data showing that for some recent models 90 percent of ankle replacements were still in place after an average of eight and a half years though the four devices in common use have technical differences in design and in how they are implanted doctors say the choice of device matters far less than the experience of the surgeon the procedure is among the most difficult that foot and ankle surgeons perform and one of the biggest challenges is getting proper alignment of the replacement joint dr brian donley an orthopedic surgeon who is director of the foot and ankle center at the cleveland clinic says patients should always ask their doctor to disclose any financial interest in a device he performed the first united states operation using the salto talaris device from tornier of minneapolis and receives consulting fees from the company even with a successful implantation patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at 18 they should not try to return to activities like basketball and distance running but golf and walking and sometimes even skiing are typically allowed my happiest patients i have in my practice are my ankle replacement

fake,make that a bottomless cup coffee and tea drinkers are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than nondrinkers with those drinking three to four cups a day at a 25 percent lower risk for the disease than those who drink less than two cups a large analysis has found it does not matter whether the drinks are caffeinated or not said the study published in the archives of internal medicine the analysis does not prove that drinking tea or coffee lowers the risk of the socalled adultonset diabetes but it is not the first study to report such a link and it goes further than other studies finding that for caffeinated coffee risk dropped by 5 percent to 10 percent with each additional cup consumed which the researchers say suggests a causal relationship those drinking more than six cups of coffee a day were at 40 percent lower risk for diabetes than nondrinkers the figure for those who drank less than a cup per day was just 4 percent some studies have indicated that chemical components of tea and coffee may have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity but the evidence is mixed caffeine cant be the answer because you see the same sort of overall response from diabetes with decaf as with caffeinated coffee said the papers senior author mark woodward a professor at mount sinai medical center in new york study finds drinking coffee and tea cuts risk of type 2 diabetes
fake,dec 21 2009 a fatty substance found naturally in the lungs may provide a natural defense against respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection new research suggests the substance a lipid known as popg may prevent rsv infection as well as limit the spread of the virus once infection has occurred our findings demonstrate that popg is a potent antiviral agent both as a prophylactic and after infection has occurred researcher dennis voelker phd professor of medicine at national jewish health in denver says in a news release while these are still early studies several characteristics of popg make me believe that it has real potential as both an antiviral and antiinflammatory treatment rsv is the major cause of hospitalization in young children under age 2 and is an increasingly problematic infection in adults with chronic lung disease the elderly and those with weakened immune systems there is no vaccine or easy effective treatment for rsv popgis one of several lipids found in the fluid that lines the air sacs of the lungs researchers say that until now the function of popg has been unclear in the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences researchers examined the effects of popg on rsv infection in human lung cells in the lab and in mice infected with the virus they found that inoculating human lung cells with popg before exposure to rsv prevented infection with the virus as well as the cell death and inflammation normally associated with rsv infection applying popg to the cells after rsv infection also inhibited the spread of the virus to neighboring healthy cells in addition the study showed treating infected mice with popg dramatically reduced infection and prevented the spread of the inflammatory cells into the lungs researchers say popg appears to work by binding to rsv and preventing it from binding to other cells the findings also suggest that popgs role in the lungs may be to help the lungs tolerate the daily barrage of inhaled irritants popg is already used in other treatments and has been safely given to millions of premature infants to protect their lungs it is also inexpensive and easy to use therefore together with the results of this study researchers say the compound merits further research as a treatment for rsv infection in humans natural treatment for rsv infection

fake,dec 14 2009 a less invasive needle biopsy may be nearly as effective as surgical biopsy at diagnosing breast cancer and with far fewer side effects a new review of more than 80 studies on the two breast cancer screening methods shows breast needle biopsy was able to distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous breast lesions with about the same accuracy as surgical biopsy and less than half the risk of complications women suspected of having breast cancer after initial screening are usually referred for a biopsy to determine whether the lesion is cancerous in most cases the lump or lesion is benign or noncancerous and does not require further treatment biopsies may be performed via open surgery on the breast or with a less invasive coreneedle biopsy in which a small sample of breast tissue from the affected area is removed through a special needle inserted through the skin researchers say needle biopsy has fewer complications and a shorter recovery time than open surgical biopsy but some women and doctors may have concerns about the accuracy of the procedure compared with traditional open surgery methods of breast cancer diagnosis in the study published in the annals of internal medicine researchers reviewed 83 studies on the two methods the results showed that core needle biopsies were about as accurate as open surgery at detecting cancerous vs noncancerous breast lesions needle biopsies also had a much lower rate of complications less than 1 compared with 210 with open surgery in addition the study showed women initially diagnosed with breast cancer with needle biopsy were more likely to be treated with a single breast cancer surgery than those initially diagnosed by open surgical biopsy based on currently available evidence it appears reasonable to substitute core needle biopsy procedures for open surgical biopsy given the comparable sensitivity and lower complication rates write researcher wendy bruening phd of the ecri institute evidencebased practices center in plymouth meeting pa and colleagues they say additional studies are needed to find out what factors affect the accuracy of coreneedle breast biopsy diagnosing breast cancer needle biopsy best
fake,cnn as a thick gray haze began to descend over the words in her schoolbooks and eventually the faces of loved ones barbara campbell barely grasped that she was going blind i didnt realize that i wasnt seeing the same as everybody else because how would i know that said campbell 56 who began losing her sight in middle school by the time campbell reached adulthood her vision was gone its like looking through a frosted window campbell said of how she sees the world its like that all the time doctors diagnosed retinitis pigmentosa a progressive eye disease that damages the cells of the retina the part of the eye that detects light for years campbell survived even thrived as a blind woman navigating new york city then earlier this year she went from coping with blindness to hoping she might see again campbell is one of only 14 people in the united states participating in an fdaapproved study of an artificial retina a microchip implanted in the eye to stimulate damaged cells amazing said campbell with a smile its like star trek a microchip to help someone see may sound more like a star trek device than legitimate science but it is real this is really the first step toward a really bionic eye said aries arditi a senior fellow in vision science at lighthouse international a nonprofit advocacy group for the blind and one of the study sites for the artificial retina a healthy retina sends electrical signals to the brain telling it how to decipher light a damaged retina cannot transmit those signals so the artificial retina is outfitted with rows of tiny electrodes to do the job in july campbell underwent surgery to implant the microchip into her eye when light goes into campbells eyes she doesnt see anything because its not being projected by the cells of the retina said dr lucian del priore an ophthalmologist at new york presbyteriancolumbia university medical center who implanted campbells artificial retina this is an artificial device that essentially stimulates the retina electrically del priore said how to see a tree artificially since her eyes cannot detect light or images on their own campbell wears a pair of sunglasses outfitted with a small camera as she scans and focuses the camera on an object in her environment for example a tree a wireless device transmits that image to the artificial retina inside her eye the electrodes on the microchip then stimulate cells on the retina roughly in the shape of the tree the shape is communicated to the brain the idea being that campbell might one day perceive some semblance of a shape of that tree its a rudimentary level of vision said brian mech vice president of business development at second sight medical products inc the developer and manufacturer of the artificial retina but for people without vision that can be pretty remarkable in 2002 the firstgeneration artificial retina had only 16 electrodes patients were able to do things that we would not have anticipated with so few electrodes mech said one patient could shoot baskets and another was crossing crosswalks campbell received one of the secondgeneration artificial retinas with 60 electrodes and thus far according to her doctors has made significant progress when she stands outside her apartment building she can now sense light emanating from windows navigating up the stairs of her building she now knows that there is light illuminating the hallways and when she arrives home and makes tea she can sense light coming from the burners on the stove and just recently during a vision test campbell was able to correctly identify a sequence of letters for the first time in decades i was like youre kidding campbell said i was shocked i still cant believe it campbells doctors try to temper her excitement and that of other study participants being able to repair in some way a function that has been lost is a very exciting thing del priore said but it is important to be realistic recognizing faces driving or reading the small print in newspapers is a very long way off mech said and while some patients like campbell do well with the implant there are some who struggle still the feeling among those involved in the study is tempered excitement we can now take someone who is totally blind and turn them into someone with very very poor vision said arditi who trains campbell weekly on how to nurture her vision thats really the first time in history weve been able to do that devices with 100 and 1000 electrodes are in production and the hope mech said is that more electrodes will mean moredetailed vision today the artificial retina is primarily for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa but it could expand to other diseases like dry agerelated macular degeneration mech said there are 100000 people in the united states affected by retinitis pigmentosa according to the national eye institute a division of the national institutes of health training campbells eye and brain to see again will take years of rehabilitation her vision is in blackandwhite and will never be perfect those factors do not prevent campbell from dreaming what id actually really hoped and im not sure if its going to happen is seeing colors campbell said if i could see colors again my plan was to go to the grand canyon artificial retina gives woman limited vision after decades of darkness
