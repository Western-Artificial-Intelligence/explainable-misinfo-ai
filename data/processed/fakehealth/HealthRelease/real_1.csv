real,wilmington de december 17 2018 the crisprcas9 gene editing system may be able to restore the effectiveness of firstline chemotherapies used to treat lung cancer by deleting or knocking out a gene in cancer tumors that helps the tumors develop resistance to the drugs that was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal molecular therapy oncolytics by scientists from the gene editing institute of the helen f graham cancer center research institute at christiana care health system the study reports that in both tissue culture and in a mouse tumor growth stopped and there was a dramatic decrease in the volume of existing tumors when chemotherapy was combined with cripspcas9 which was used to disable a tumor gene known as nrf2 previous studies have shown that the nrf2 gene controls cell functions in lung cancer tumors that helps them thwart the effect of chemotherapies that might otherwise reduce or eliminate them entirely our goal is to see if crispr can be used with chemotherapy to provide a safe affordable way to give patients who are not responding to treatment at least a fighting chance against this very challenging cancer said eric kmiec phd the principal author of the study and the director of the gene editing institute we believe that finding ways to use crispr to improve existing treatments will lead to some of the first benefits for patients while we tackle the vital ethical issues around the use of crispr for edits that can be passed on through dna this is an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing the study was led by pawel bialk research scientist at the gene editing institute the nations only crisprfocused research initiative situated in a community health care system lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the united states dr kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease but he said some patients with nonsmallcell lung cancer the most common form of lung cancer are resistant to chemotherapy agents used to treat the disease or develop resistance after being exposed to the drugs developing crispr in a community health center a patientfocused approach dr kmiec said the lung cancer work reflects an approach adopted by the gene editing institute to move cautiously in developing medical applications of gene editing based inside the helen f graham cancer center research institute at christiana care his research team gains unique insight into the lives and needs of cancer patients and the health care professionals who care for them which helps them to maintain a strong focus on doing whats right for patients dr kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials the crispr application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patients genome only the genes in the tumor crispr stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats it was originally a defense mechanism found in bacteria that allows the bacteria to recognize and slice up the dna of invading viruses scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of dna codewhich acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell cas9 is a reference to an enzyme sometimes described as a form of molecular scissors that is used by crispr to cut out a section of dna code research aimed at realworld affordable solutions dr kmiec said there are many efforts under way to modify crispr so that it can be used to not only remove or knock out a section dna but also to replace or knock in a new strand of code but he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of crispr application he said for now his team is focused on using crispr in its native form which is to just cut out a section of dna and to start with applications that do not directly impact the patients dna he said using crispr to do things like improving drug response represents the lowhanging fruit of crispr patient applications we think its best to start with crispr therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool dr kmiec said this approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage dr kmiec said that as a crispr research program that treats patients from across the economic spectrum his scientists are keenly aware of the challenges of making cutting edge medical treatments accessible and beneficial for all patients this work is another significant step on the pathway to fda approval said nicholas j petrelli md facs bank of america endowed medical director of the helen f graham cancer center research institute the gene editing institute is taking a careful and methodical approach to developing innovative therapies dr kmiec and his team interact with our oncologists who deal with lung cancer every day on how gene editing could have a realistic impact and improve treatment this multidisciplinary clinicalscientific team has been working together to develop a compassionate benchtobedside approach their laboratory benches are literally down the hall from our patients and the oncologists offices
real,researchers at johns hopkins medicine have identified in live human brains new radioactive tracer molecules that bind to and light up tau tangles a protein associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimers disease and other related dementias two studies will be published backtoback in the december issue of journal of nuclear medicineone as featured article of the monthdescribing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with alzheimers disease as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins one of the greatest public health challenges is alzheimers disease for which there currently is no cure and no definitive diagnostic until autopsy says dean wong md phd professor of radiology and radiological sciences psychiatry and behavioral sciences neurology and neuroscience and director of the section of high resolution brain pet imaging division of nuclear medicine at the johns hopkins university school of medicine we have been working hard to identify new radiopharmaceuticals that can help speed the discoveries of diagnostics and treatments for these devastating neurodegenerative disorders alzheimers disease is characterized in the brain by the appearance of two abnormal protein structures amyloid plaques and tangled fibers made up of a protein called tau one of the biggest challenges in studying alzheimers disease thus far according to wong is the inability to watch these socalled neurofibrillary tangles develop in real time as part of a longer term project funded by f hoffmanla roche the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate tau pet radiopharmaceuticals these three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates and the results looked promising enough to test in people the researchers recruited a total of 12 patients with alzheimers disease seven younger healthy controls ages 2538 years old and five older healthy controls age 50 or older for brainonly pet scans an additional six older healthy controls were recruited for fullbody scanning the study was divided into three parts in the first part each person was injected with two of the three randomly designated tracers on separate visits prior to receiving a brain pet scan with subsequent evaluation to determine which molecule performed best in the second part of the study researchers tested the optimal tracer called f18 ro948 with additional brain imaging in five patients with alzheimers and five older controls with followup of previously seen patients to evaluate the potential progression of tau protein tangling after an average span of approximately 16 months the third part of the study examined six older controls undergoing wholebody scanning in total the researchers looked at 80 different regions in the brain to evaluate how well the tracers were taken up by the brain how well they penetrated through the tissue and how specifically they bound to the tau protein rather than just sticking indiscriminately to anything regions of the brain that typically contain accumulated tau protein include the temporal lobe parietal lobe and occipital lobe among others grey matter in the cerebellum is thought to contain low or no tau in patients with alzheimers they found that healthy brains retained little to no tracer whereas the brains of those with alzheimers showed tau to be in regions of the brain consistent with previously reported postmortem data on filamentous tangles in the second paper the team examined the detailed quantification of tau binding via f18 ro948 in 11 patients with alzheimers disease five young cognitively normal controls and five older cognitively normal controls they verified that detailed quantification of the tested and retested tracer in those five patients with alzheimers and five older controls generated good and reproducible results according to wong this body of work reveals that as compared with the currently used tau tracer f18 av1451 the new tracer f18 ro948 does not bind randomly to other tissue offering greater clarity into quantification of potential tau burden within the human brain it really takes a village to make progress in biomedical research and this project was no exception with the involvement of the pet team at hopkins a cro who helped recruit healthy subjects colleagues in psychiatry and behavioral sciences colleagues at the national institute of aging and neuroscience imaging experts at roche says wong this is a true example of crossdisciplinary collaboration and im honored to have such great collaborators
real,san diego mayo clinic researchers have found that an oral drug apixaban used to treat blood clots in patients undergoing cancer therapy is safe and effective the drug was associated with fewer major bleeding events and fewer recurrent blood clots compared to lowmolecular weight heparin their findings were presented at the annual meeting of the american society of hematology by robert mcbane ii md a mayo clinic cardiologist nearly 1 in 5 patients with cancer will develop a clot in the veins referred to as either a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism says dr mcbane clotting events can be deadly with pulmonary embolism being the second most common cause of death in cancer patients while twicedaily injections of lowmolecularweight heparin has been the traditional treatment of choice for cancer patients who suffer a venous clot dr mcbane notes that there are numerous limitations to this therapy these injections can be painful and cause considerable bruising at the injection site injections are expensive at nearly 100 per day and cancer patients may experience low platelet counts and be at risk for a clotting disorder called heparininduced thrombocytopenia dr mcbane noted that cancer and cancer treatment can be associated with kidney injury which can limit the drugs use further finally dr mcbane says there isnt is a good antidote for this medication should a bleeding problem arise more recently a number of new blood thinners called direct oral anticoagulants have become available says dr mcbane as a class these drugs have a number of advantages including oral delivery lack of interactions with foods or other medications and the lack of a need for monitoring drug levels he says these qualities make this class of drug much easier to use than the traditional blood thinners however it was unclear whether these drugs could be used safely in cancer patients until now dr mcbane says quality of life surveys which were taken monthly throughout the sixmonth trial showed that patients markedly preferred oral apixaban over injectable dalteparin we are hopeful that this medication will also improve medication compliance in cancer patients requiring blood thinner therapy

real,one day mri brain scans may help predict whether older people will develop dementia new research suggests in a small study mri brain scans predicted with 89 percent accuracy who would go on to develop dementia within three years according to research at washington university school of medicine in st louis and the university of california san francisco the findings presented sunday nov 25 at the radiological society of north america meeting in chicago suggest that doctors may one day be able to use widely available tests to tell people their risk of developing dementia before symptoms arise right now its hard to say whether an older person with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment is likely to develop dementia said lead author cyrus a raji md phd an assistant professor of radiology at washington universitys mallinckrodt institute of radiology we showed that a single mri scan can predict dementia on average 26 years before memory loss is clinically detectable which could help doctors advise and care for their patients alzheimers disease is a progressive irreversible brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills the disease affects 55 million americans according to the national institutes of health nih neurologists can get a ballpark estimate of a patients risk of alzheimers dementia using the minimental state examination questionnaire or by testing for the highrisk form of the gene apoe which increases a persons risk of alzheimers by up to 12fold both tests were about 70 to 80 percent accurate in this study other assessments such as pet scans for plaques of alzheimers proteins in the brain are good at detecting early signs of alzheimers disease but available to few patients pet scans cost thousands of dollars and require radioactive materials not found in a typical hospital mri brain scans are widely available and give doctors a glimpse into whats going on inside a persons brain raji and colleagues at the school of medicine including tammie benzinger md phd a professor of radiology parinaz massoumzadeh phd and adedamola adedokun as well as radiologist pratik mukherjee md phd of the university of california san francisco analyzed mri scans for physical signs of impending cognitive decline they used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brains white matter which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another diffusion tensor imaging is a way of measuring the movement of water molecules along white matter tracts raji said if water molecules are not moving normally it suggests underlying damage to white tracts that can underlie problems with cognition using information from the alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative a multisite collaboration that pools data funding and expertise to improve clinical trials for alzheimers disease raji and colleagues identified 10 people whose cognitive skills declined over a twoyear period and matched them by age and sex with 10 people whose thinking skills held steady the average age of people in both groups was 73 then the researchers analyzed diffusion tensor mri scans taken just before the twoyear period for all 20 people the researchers found that people who went on to experience cognitive decline had significantly more signs of damage to their white matter the researchers repeated their analysis in a separate sample of 61 people using a more refined measure of white matter integrity with this new analysis they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain when the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage the accuracy rose to 95 percent we could tell that the individuals who went on to develop dementia have these differences on diffusion mri compared with scans of cognitively normal people whose memory and thinking skills remained intact raji said what we need now before we can bring it into the clinic is to get more control subjects and develop computerized tools that can more reliably compare individual patients scans to a baseline normal standard with that doctors might soon be able to tell people whether they are likely to have alzheimers develop in the next few years although there are no drugs available yet to prevent or delay the onset of alzheimers disease identifying those at high risk of developing dementia within the next few years could still be beneficial the researchers said people could make decisions on their financial and living arrangements while they are still in full control of their faculties
real,chapel hill university of north carolina lineberger comprehensive cancer center researchers have found that mailing selfcollection kits to test for highrisk human papillomavirus infection has the potential to boost cervical cancer screening especially for lowincome women who are overdue for testing in the journal obstetrics gynecology researchers published the results of mailing athome hpv selfcollection kits to 193 lowincome women in north carolina who were overdue for screening according to national guidelines they reported this screening approach detected highrisk hpv in all of the cases of women who were found to have highgrade abnormal cervical precancerous growths showing that selfcollection at home for hpv may be a viable method to identify women at highrisk for cervical cancer this is a demonstration that mailing selfcollection kits and returning them to test for highrisk hpv infection has big potential to increase screening access among underscreened women and to do that successfully said unc linebergers jennifer s smith the studys senior author and a professor in the unc gillings school of global public health although cervical cancer is preventable through early detection and treatment the american cancer society estimates that more than 4100 women will die from cervical cancer in the united states this year nearly 20 percent of women in the united states who are eligible for cervical cancer screening report they havent been tested for cervical cancer within the recommended time interval national surveys have shown women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either havent been vaccinated against hpv in adolescence or theyve not been getting screened according to national guidelines smith said increasing screening rates among underscreened women is of paramount importance in 2014 the us food and drug administration signed off on using an hpv test alone to screen for cervical cancer for women 25 years and older in conjunction with the pap test earlier this year the us preventive services task force gave an a rating to hpv primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65 there are a lot of different barriers that cause women to be underscreened said the studys first author andrea des marais mph project manager with the unc gillings school of global public health hpv tests are being widely used now in the united states but only through physician collection in clinical practice which requires that women come to a clinic offering hpv testing using selfcollection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened those who dont access regular medical care for the study researchers mailed athome selfcollection kits to lowincome women in north carolina who were overdue for screening by national guidelines they included women between the ages of 30 and 64 years who had reported no history of receiving a pap test which checks for precancerous or cancerous cells within the past four years researchers provided study participants with selfcollection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina the brush samples were then tested in a lab for hpv and other sexually transmitted infections participants also selfcollected samples at a clinic and handed them to a nurse and had a pelvic exam for a clinician to collect a pap smear sample the researchers compared the results from self and cliniciansamples which were tested for highrisk hpv strains that are linked to cervical cancer to the pap results and the results of cervical biopsies collected during colposcopy which is a secondary diagnostic test that confirms the presence of cervical precancerous lesions among women with abnormal pap smear results the home selfcollection test indicated that 124 percent of women were infected with highrisk hpv the selfcollection tests used in the clinic found 155 of the women had highrisk hpv infection and the cliniciancollected test identified 114 percent of the women had highrisk hpv infection we found comparable detection between selfcollection and physiciancollection des marais said all women found to have highgrade cervical lesions by pap smear or by cervical biopsy were positive for highrisk hpv on their home selfcollected sample we found in this sample all of the women who had highgrade lesions had hpvpositive home selfcollection results smith said we didnt miss any of those highgrade cases by conducting home selfcollection smith said there is more work to be done such as identifying ways to make the selfcollection process more efficient and costeffective and getting fda approval for the clinical use of selfcollection for cervical cancer screening this is a proofinprinciple study that we used to determine whether home selfcollection is highly effective for detecting highgrade disease smith said we are already working on the next step which is a clinical trial in which women who arent uptodate on screening get either a referral to a free clinic appointment to receive a screening or receive a selfcollection kit in the mail followed by referral to a free clinic appointment this will allow us to determine the effect that selfcollection has on screening uptake
real,when it comes to preventing blood clots after a knee replacement good old aspirin may be just as effective as newer more expensive drugs that swap could help reduce the cost of caring for the nearly 1 million americans who have a knee fixed each year michigan medicine researchers say after knee surgery theres a risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs so its routine for patients to take clotpreventing drugs for some time afterward some doctors choose powerful anticlotting drugs like heparin lovenox and rivaroxaban xarelto but it hasnt been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap readily available aspirin aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments says brian r hallstrom md an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the university of michigan department of orthopaedic surgery hallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in jama surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants aspirin use growing during the twoyear study period from 2013 to 2015 aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the michigan arthroplasty registry collaborative quality initiative a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements since then the shift has become even more distinct aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among michigan surgeons says hallstrom who is codirector of the initiative and a health services researcher at ums institute for healthcare policy and innovation based on the experience of 41537 michigan patients undergoing knee replacement the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention a recent canadian study looked at the issue but the analysis had a caveat each of the more than 3400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery after that they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin the new um study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one this study is truly a realworld experience of what happened in michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin hallstrom says the incidence of blood clots pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice shifting procedure and dialogue over the past decade surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots these days most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons those reasons include shorter surgical times less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery hallstrom says some patients are even going home the same day the most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving says hallstrom noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long such as on an airplane or a hospital bed still pharmaceutical recommendations vary the critical care specialists who make up the american college of chest physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots while the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots advantages of aspirin the um study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group onethird of the patients took aspirin alone 54 percent took only an anticoagulant and 13 percent took an aspirinanticoagulant combination over three months just 116 percent of aspirin patients developed a serious blood clot that was true for 142 percent of anticoagulant patients according to the michigan study this was not statistically different so neither drug appeared better than the other but aspirin has some obvious advantages aspirin is easy to take and much less expensive hallstrom says patients can get it over the counter for pennies while the other anticoagulants require monitoring injections frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive the reported cost for a 30day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately 379 to 450 heparin is estimated at 450 to 890 although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30day supply its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in hallstrom says in contrast aspirin costs approximately 2 a month the study suggests most patients can have just aspirin without increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism but doctors need to consider factors such as a patients history of clots obesity and ability to mobilize after surgery when determining the best measure for clot prevention hallstrom adds

real,data from a clinical trial has shown that how people respond to treatment for bipolar disorder may be influenced by their weight and the overall quality of their diet including whether they are eating a diet high in foods thought to contribute to general inflammation these are early results but if replicated may mean that treatment of some mental health problems could benefit from the inclusion of dietary advice this is presented at the ecnp conference in barcelona bipolar disorder which used to be called manic depression is characterised by episodes of mood swings between being very up or very down with periods in between the two extremes the fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult while current medications are useful they are better at targeting mania symptoms the up phase leaving a lack of effective treatment for people experiencing depressive episodes now a group of australian german and american scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet a less inflammatory diet andor a low bmi body mass index may respond better to an addon nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial if we can confirm these results then its good news for people with bipolar disorder as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of bipolar disorder said lead researcher melanie ashton of deakin university in australia a total of 133 participants were randomly assigned to take a combination of nutraceuticals compounds derived from foods such as vitamins or minerals that treat or prevent a disease or disorder including the antiinflammatory amino acid nacetylcysteine nac or nac alone or a placebo a dummy pill for 16 weeks participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving researchers measured bmi at the beginning of the study and then measured depression and how a person is able to function in their day to day life researchers also rated whether a participant was improving and if so how much over the next 20 weeks participants filled in a questionnaire about what they usually eat over the year and researchers calculated a diet quality score where good diets included a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables whereas poorerquality diets had more saturated fat refined carbohydrates and alcohol these types of diets were then categorised as either antiinflammatory or proinflammatory based on foods that affect inflammation melanie ashton continued we found that people who had a betterquality diet a diet with antiinflammatory properties or a lower bmi showed better response to addon nutraceutical treatment than did those who reported a lowquality diet or a diet including foods that promote inflammation or who were overweight what this means if these results can be repeated in a larger trial is that treatment for bipolar disorder would need to take into account what a person eats and their weight there are some points we need to note about this study this is a randomised controlled trial but what we found were exploratory outcomes in other words it wasnt the main result that we were testing our result is statistically significant but because the study wasnt specifically designed to test the effect of diet quality inflammatory diets and bmi on drug response in general it is necessary to see the work replicated in a larger study before any firm conclusions can be formed commenting professor eduard vieta barcelona said this is interesting work which holds out the possibility that patients with bipolar disorder may benefit from a balanced diet however it is an early study and we need more research before we can think whether this might affect clinical practice professor vieta was not involved in this work it is an independent comment
real,new research from the university of british columbia and the university of saskatchewan is adding new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option for prenatal care especially for women who have low socioeconomic status the study published today in the british medical journal open found that lowincome pregnant women who receive care from a midwife compared to a physician are less likely to go into early labour to have a baby with a low birth weight or to have a smallforgestational age birth meaning a fetus or infant that is smaller or less developed than normal for the number of weeks in pregnancy midwives general practitioners gps and obstetricians obs are all qualified to provide safe prenatal care for women during their pregnancy labour and birth but each offer a different style of care that matches different womens preferences and needs midwives are experts in the care of women having healthy pregnancies and tend to spend more time with their patients with a focus on the overall physical emotional and psychological wellbeing of mothers and their newborns our findings show that women who are more vulnerable benefit from the care of a midwife likely because they receive more time counselling and education on how to care for themselves said the studys lead author daphne mcrae a postdoctoral research fellow at the ubc school of population and public health who conducted the study while she was a phd student at the university of saskatchewan for the study the researchers followed 57872 women in bc who carried a single baby had lowtomoderate risk pregnancies and received medical insurance premium assistance sometime between 2005 and 2012 they used maternity medical billing and demographic data to investigate the odds of smallforgestational age birth preterm birth and low birth weight for lowincome women receiving care from a midwife gp or ob after controlling for differences such as age previous pregnancies where they lived and preexisting medical conditions the researchers found that lowincome women who were receiving prenatal care from a midwife had 29 per cent lower odds of a smallforgestational age birth compared to women who received care from a gp compared to those who received care from an ob lowincome women receiving midwifery care had a 41 per cent reduction in odds for smallforgestational age birth the researchers found mcrae said the findings add new evidence in support of midwifery care and support the development of policies to ensure midwives are available and accessible especially for lowincome women midwifery is not available in all parts of the country waitlists for midwives can be quite long so women who are educated and healthconscious typically access midwives early on in their pregnancies said mcrae but more vulnerable women might not be as aware of the services available to them so expanding midwifery to make it available for all women is important our research could help develop policies that make the service more accessible to lowincome women added senior author nazeem muhajarine a professor in community health and epidemiology at the university of saskatchewan and mcraes supervisor while she conducted the research
real,new york treatment with a her2targeted therapeutic cancer vaccine provided clinical benefit to several patients with metastatic her2positive cancers who had not previously been treated with a her2targeted therapeutic according to data from a phase i clinical trial presented at the fourth cricimteatiaacr international cancer immunotherapy conference translating science into survival held sept 30oct 3 among 11 evaluable patients who had received more than the lowest dose of the vaccine six 54 percent had clinical benefit one patient with ovarian cancer had a complete response that lasted 89 weeks one patient with gastroesophageal cancer had a partial response that lasted 16 weeks and four patients two with colon cancer one with prostate cancer and one with ovarian cancer had stable disease immunotherapy marshals the exquisite specificity of the immune system to destroy cancer and some types may have potentially fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy said jay a berzofsky md phd chief of the vaccine branch at the center for cancer research national cancer institute national institutes of health bethesda maryland we are using a vaccine approach to generate an immune response to her2 which is found at high levels on and drives the growth of several types of cancer including breast ovarian lung colorectal and gastroesophageal cancers our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine for her2overexpressing cancers continued berzofsky we hope that one day the vaccine will provide a new treatment option for patients with these cancers the patients vaccines are individually customized by berzofsky and colleagues using their own immune cells isolated from their blood the bloodderived immune cells are modified in several ways in the laboratory the final product which is administered intradermally between the layers of the skin comprises patientderived dendritic cells genetically modified with an adenovirus to produce parts of the her2 protein preclinical studies which were previously published in the aacr journal cancer research showed that this type of vaccine could eradicate large established tumors as well as lung metastases in mice in the dose escalation portion of the phase i clinical trial patients were injected with the vaccine on weeks 0 4 8 16 and 24 after enrollment in the study among the six patients who received the lowest dose of the vaccine 5 million dendritic cells per injection no clinical benefit was seen among the 11 patients who received either 10 million or 20 million dendritic cells per injection six had clinical benefit adverse reactions were predominantly injectionsite reactions that did not require treatment no cardiotoxicity was seen based on the current safety and clinical benefit data the dose of the vaccine was increased to 40 million dendritic cells per injection and the trial opened to patients who have previously been treated with a her2targeted therapeutic including patients with breast cancer said berzofsky moving forward we would like to investigate whether we can increase the proportion of people who benefit from treatment with the vaccine by combining it with checkpoint inhibitor therapy he added according to berzofsky the main scientific limitation of the study is that it is a relatively small phase i clinical trial with no placebo control however the approach is sufficiently promising to warrant additional trials
real,a comparison of 2 of the most common combination therapies for locally advanced prostate cancer show the more aggressive option is linked with a higher rate of survival philadelphia highrisk prostate cancer that which has continued to grow but not yet metastasized is commonly treated with combination therapies each method has pros and cons but there is little clarity whether one might be more effective than the other for the first time researchers have shown that more patients live longer if treated with the combination of prostate removal plus radiation therapy the research was published september 25th in the journal cancer theres a lot of debate about whether to remove the whole prostate and follow up with radiation therapy or as a second option to spare the prostate and treat it using radiation therapy plus hormoneblocking therapy said senior author grace luyao phd associate director of population science at the sidney kimmel cancer center jefferson health one of only eight ncidesignated cancer centers nationwide with a prostate cancer program of excellence our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer the risks of prostate removal or prostatectomy are well known and include higher chance of developing incontinence and erectile dysfunction there are some risks associated with radiation treatment and hormone therapy but they are less common and are typically thought to have a lower impact on quality of life prostatectomy is an unpopular treatment said luyao our study showed that only six percent of men with highrisk cancer were treated with it its not just the risk of side effectsfor some men especially those who are not fit enough for the surgery prostatectomy is not an option however this may be an option for some patients to reconsider in the largest populationbased retrospective study to date dr luyao and colleagues examined the records of 13856 men in the medicareseer registry diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer cancer growth that had not yet metastasized to distant sites in the body dr luyao and colleagues looked at the patients who were treated either with prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation as one group and compared them to another group who were treated with radiation therapy plus hormoneblocking therapy they matched the comparison groups by age race and comorbidity to control for factors that may influence patient outcomes and analyzed which group did better 10 to 15 years after their procedures they found that 10 years after treatment 89 percent of the prostate removal plus radiation group was still alive that compared with the 74 percent survival at ten years in the group that received only radiation plus hormone therapy amounting to a 15 percent survival advantage in the group that was treated with prostate removal for highrisk prostate patients we started the use of aggressive radiation therapy after surgery 20 years ago said adam dicker senior vice president and chair of the department of enterprise radiation oncology at jefferson health who was not involved in the study we recognized that it may have curative potential however the proportion of men undergoing prostatectomy plus radiation therapy decreased significantly over time and there were tradeoffs for the survival advantages said dr luyao men who received the combination of surgery and radiotherapy had higher rates of erectile dysfunction 28 percent vs 20 percent and higher rates of urinary incontinence 49 percent vs 19 percent another interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer two modes of treatment are recommended by both united states and european guidelines for cancer treatment it was surprising to see only 29 percent of patients received the recommended combination therapies and as many as 20 percent are not getting any treatment six months after their diagnosis said dr luyao our data cant tell us the reason for this deviation from guidelines and further studies are needed one of the strengths of retrospective studies of patient data is that it reveals what happens in the real world rather than the carefully controlled context of a clinical trial said dr luyao our data is revealing the realworld practice as well as some of the advantages and disadvantages of those medical preferences this important study demonstrates that many men with highrisk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multimodality approach to their disease several large clinical trials are nearing completion that should validate these retrospective findings of the benefits of primary radical prostatectomy followed by additional therapies such as adjuvant radiation said leonard gomella chair of the department of urology at jefferson philadelphia

real,overweight people who used a new motivational intervention called functional imagery training fit lost an average of five times more weight than those using talking therapy alone shows new research published today by the university of plymouth and queensland university in addition users of fit lost 43cm more around their waist circumference in six months and continued to lose weight after the intervention had finished led by dr linda solbrig from the school of psychology the research involved 141 participants who were allocated either to fit or motivational interviewing mi a technique that sees a counsellor support someone to develop highlight and verbalise their need or motivation for change and their reasons for wanting to change fit goes one step further than mi as it makes use of multisensory imagery to explore these changes by teaching clients how to elicit and practice motivational imagery themselves everyday behaviours and optional app support are used to cue imagery practice until it becomes a cognitive habit maximum contact time was four hours of individual consultation and neither group received any additional dietary advice or information dr solbrig who completed the work as part of a phd funded by the national institute for health research nihr collaboration for leadership in applied health research and care clahrc south west peninsula said its fantastic that people lost significantly more weight on this intervention as unlike most studies it provided no dietphysical activity advice or education people were completely free in their choices and supported in what they wanted to do not what a regimen prescribed the study showed how after six months people who used the fit intervention lost an average of 411kg compared with an average of 074kg among the mi group after 12 months six months after the intervention had finished the fit group continued to lose weight with an average of 644kg lost compared with 067kg in the mi group dr solbrig continued most people agree that in order to lose weight you need to eat less and exercise more but in many cases people simply arent motivated enough to heed this advice however much they might agree with it so fit comes in with the key aim of encouraging someone to come up with their own imagery of what change might look and feel like to them how it might be achieved and kept up even when challenges arise we started with taking people through an exercise about a lemon we asked them to imagine seeing it touching it juicing it drinking the juice and juice accidently squirting in their eye to emphasise how emotional and tight to our physical sensations imagery is from there we are able to encourage them to fully imagine and embrace their own goals not just imagine how good it would be to lose weight but for example what would losing weight enable you to do that you cant do now what would that look sound smell like and encourage them to use all of their senses as well as being delighted by the success of the study in the short term there are very few studies that document weight loss past the end of treatment so to see that people continued to lose weight despite not having any support shows the sustainability and effectiveness of this intervention trisha bradbury was one of the participants allocated to the fit study and she explains i lost my mum at 60 and being 59 myself with a variety of health problems my motivation was to be there for my daughter i kept thinking about wearing the dress id bought for my daughters graduation and on days i really didnt feel like exercising kept picturing how id feel ive gone from 14 stone to 12 stone 2 and have managed to lower the dosage i need for my blood pressure tablets id still like to lose a touch more but im so delighted with the mindset shift professor jackie andrade professor in psychology at the university of plymouth is one of the cocreators of fit and she explains fit is based on two decades of research showing that mental imagery is more strongly emotionally charged than other types of thought it uses imagery to strengthen peoples motivation and confidence to achieve their goals and teaches people how to do this for themselves so they can stay motivated even when faced with challenges we were very excited to see that our intervention achieved exactly what we had hoped for and that it helped our participants achieve their goals and most importantly to maintain them
real,newswise chapel hill nc unc researchers say the results from the multisite phase 2 and 3 trials of brexanolone injection are not only promising but could change the way postpartum depression ppd is treated brexanolone injection works differently than existing antidepressant medications and if approved by the us food and drug administration fda later this year will be the first new class of antidepressants in decades and the first drug specifically indicated for ppd with current antidepressant ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors it could take four to six weeks to get a treatment response in the brexanolone trials we saw patients starting to feel better within days said the trials academic principal investigator samantha meltzerbrody md mph director of perinatal psychiatry program at the unc school of medicine david rubinow md chair of the department of psychiatry at the unc school of medicine and a coauthor of the paper says time is especially crucial for new mothers experiencing postpartum depression because the weeks and months following birth are a critical period for motherinfant bonding common symptoms of ppd a mood disorder in women that can be triggered by fluctuations in reproductive hormones include low mood feeling overwhelmed anxious and ruminating thoughts potential withdrawal from the baby and her family and suicidal thoughts in the most severe cases ppd is one of the most common complications of pregnancy with between 10 and 20 percent of mothers worldwide experiencing it having a drug developed specifically for postpartum depression is a gamechanger for womens health said meltzerbrody with our latest results we believe that brexanolone if approved could provide relief for women with a range of postpartum severity the paper published in the lancet includes a new integrated analysis of results from three doubleblind placebocontrolled trials that took place at 30 sites in the us including uncs perinatal psychiatry unit eligible women were aged 1845 years old and were six months postpartum or less at screening they also had to be experiencing moderate to severe postpartum depression which was assessed by the hamilton depression rating scale hamd the integrated analysis looked at results of the trials which randomized 209 women to receive a doubleblinded 60hour infusion of either brexanolone injection 90 gkghr or placebo a unique dose group of brexanolone 60 gkghr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis but was included in integrated analyses of safety brexanolone injection 90 gkghr was administered to 102 women with moderate or severe ppd who also were evaluated throughout the infusion after the infusion stopped and then periodically for up to 30 days another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe the first statistically significant reduction in depression severity with brexanolone injection relative to placebo was observed as early as 24 hours after dosing at the end of the 60hour infusion the average reduction in patients hamilton rating scale for depression hamd or depression severity score was 170 points for women in the brexanolone injection 90 gkghr group versus 128 in the placebo group p<00001 the reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at day 30 the most common 10 of subjects adverse events following during brexanolone injection administration were headache dizziness and somnolence this is a very different model for how we treat depression having a drug approved to treat ppd that works quickly and effectively yet is also durable would be a huge step forward for psychiatry in general meltzerbrody said brexanolone injection is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extrasynaptic gaba receptors in postpartum depression the gaba pathway may play a key role in regulating hormones that researchers believe can lead to ppd sage therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials a new drug application is currently under review by the fda and brexanolone injection has been granted breakthrough therapy designation the fda has assigned a prescription drug user fee act target date of december 19 2018 newly published results show investigational treatment brexanolone consistently reduced depressive symptoms across three postpartum depression trials supporting submission for fda approval
real,in uclaled study new treatment is more effective in people receiving immunotherapy for the first time a uclaled study has found that a treatment that uses a bacterialike agent in combination with an immunotherapy drug could help some people with advanced melanoma an aggressive form of skin cancer live longer the research showed that using the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and the experimental agent sd101 a sequence of nucleic acids that mimics a bacterial infection altered the microenvironment around the tumor in a way that enabled the immune system to more effectively attack the cancer the research was an earlystage study conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy and the findings were published today in the journal cancer discovery pembrolizumab which is marketed under the brand name keytruda works by blocking a protein called pd1 which interferes with immune system function blocking pd1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer while pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug we have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an antipd1 is that their immune system was not ready said dr antoni ribas the studys lead author a professor of medicine at the david geffen school of medicine at ucla and director of the ucla jonsson comprehensive cancer center tumor immunology program so we thought what if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer its like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it with this new approach sd101 is the match that starts the fire the researchers found that sd101 not only directs t cells to cancer cells but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the t cells so that they can better kill the cancer cells all 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely the other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study of them two had a partial response meaning parts of the tumors shrank but the tumors did not go away completely five more showed some reduction in the tumors but the other participants did respond to the therapy the results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and sd101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies for all patients with advanced cancer immunotherapy using pd1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment unfortunately this therapy still only works in a subset of patients said dr deborah wong assistant clinical professor of medicine at the geffen school of medicine and an oncologist at the ronald reagan ucla medical center who was also an author of the paper this particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the sd101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where its injected but its working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones were directly injecting the study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment we are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients said ribas who is also the director of the parker institute for cancer immunotherapy center at ucla by understanding that we can find more ways to make that therapy more active one way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies
real,dallas aug 22 2018 breastfeeding is not only good for babies there is growing evidence it may also reduce the risk for stroke in postmenopausal women who reported breastfeeding at least one child according to new research in journal of the american heart association the open access journal of the american heart associationamerican stroke association stroke is the fourth leading cause of death among women aged 65 and older and is the third leading cause of death among hispanic and black women aged 65 and older according to the study some studies have reported that breastfeeding may reduce the rates of breast cancer ovarian cancer and risk of developing type 2 diabetes in mothers recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors said lisette t jacobson phd mpa ma lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the university of kansas school of medicinewichita this is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity researchers analyzed data on 80191 participants in the womens health initiative observational study a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998 all women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed among these women 51 percent breastfed for onesix months 22 percent for seven12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months at the time of recruitment the average age was 637 years and the followup period was 126 years after adjusting for nonmodifiable stroke risk factors such as age and family history researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average 23 percent lower in all women 48 percent lower in black women 32 percent lower in hispanic women 21 percent lower in white women and 19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months a longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk if you are pregnant please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant jacobson said our study did not address whether racialethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racialethnic differences in stroke risk jacobson said because the study was observational it couldnt establish a causeandeffect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who dont is the factor changing the stroke risk however because the womens health initiative is large researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong jacobson said breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke others include getting adequate exercise choosing healthy foods not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range jacobson said the study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the followup period just 34 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 16 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study and by the womens health initiatives exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment currently the american academy of pediatrics and the world health organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer for babies health the american heart association recommends breastfeeding for 12 months with transition to other additional sources of nutrients beginning at about four six months of age to ensure sufficient micronutrients in the diet
real,an international team of researchers has developed a simple laboratory score that is safer and faster at diagnosing patients who visit the emergency department with heart attack symptoms the score published in cmaj canadian medical association journal can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge we have developed a simple lab score that is superior to using cardiac troponin alone for the identification of patients at low and high risk for heart attack or death at emergency department presentation say dr peter kavsak mcmaster university hamilton ontario according to professor andrew worster also from mcmaster university this lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients patients with chest pain symptoms require multiple blood tests over several hours before a diagnosis is reached previous studies using highsensitivity cardiac troponin alone to rule out and rule in heart attacks have not consistently demonstrated sufficient safety to use in clinical practice in this international study researchers from canada australia new zealand and germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score or clinical chemistry score to diagnose heart attack these blood tests are part of the world health organizations list of essential in vitro diagnostics tests for health care facilities with clinical laboratories the researchers validated the clinical chemistry score as a predictor of heart attack or death within 30 days using data on 4245 patients from emergency department studies in the four countries within one month of the emergency department visits 727 heart attacks or death in patients occurred a negative or lowrisk clinical chemistry score at emergency department presentation missed only one of these events compared with up to 25 missed heart attacksdeath when using a highsensitivity cardiac troponin test alone a positive or highrisk clinical chemistry score also identified about 75 of patients at high risk of heart attack or death when positive compared with a low of 40 detected when the highsensitivity cardiac troponin test alone was positive the clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women the authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety adoption of the clinical chemistry score algorithm would standardize reporting of highsensitivity cardiac troponin test results how the tests are interpreted in the normal range and represent an option less susceptible to both analytical and preanalytical errors this could result in the safest laboratory approach for physicians to use at presentation in the emergency department says dr kavsak
real,blood test may identify gestational diabetes risk in first trimester nih analysis suggests early screening could allow for lifestyle changes before condition develops a blood test conducted as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes a pregnancyrelated condition that poses potentially serious health risks for mothers and infants according to researchers at the national institutes of health and other institutions the study appears in scientific reports gestational diabetes occurs only in pregnancy and results when the level of blood sugar or glucose rises too high gestational diabetes increases the mothers chances for high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy and the need for cesarean delivery and the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life for infants gestational diabetes increases the risk for large birth size unless they have a known risk factor such as obesity women typically are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy in the current study researchers evaluated whether the hba1c test also called the a1c test commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy the test approximates the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months based on the amount of glucose that has accumulated on the surface of red blood cells according to the authors comparatively few studies have examined whether the hba1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition the test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy the researchers analyzed records from the nichd fetal growth study a large observational study that recruited more than 2000 lowrisk pregnant women from 12 us clinical sites between 2009 and 2013 the researchers compared hba1c test results from 107 women who later developed gestational diabetes to test results from 214 women who did not develop the condition most of the women had tests at four intervals during pregnancy early weeks 813 middle weeks 1622 and 2429 and late weeks 3437 women who went on to develop gestational diabetes had higher hba1c levels an average of 53 percent compared to those without gestational diabetes an average hba1c level of 51 percent each 1 percent increase in hba1c above 51 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22percent higher risk for gestational diabetes in middle pregnancy hba1c levels declined for both groups however hba1c levels increased in the final third of pregnancy which is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to insulin that often occurs during this time period our results suggest that the hba1c test potentially could help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes early in pregnancy when lifestyle changes may be more effective in reducing their risk said the studys senior author cuilin zhang phd of the epidemiology branch at nihs eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development exercise and a healthy diet may lower blood glucose levels during pregnancy if these measures are not successful physicians may prescribe insulin to bring blood glucose under control the authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring hba1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a womans later risk for gestational diabetes similarly research is needed to determine whether lowering hba1c with lifestyle changes either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy could reduce the risk for the condition about the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development nichd nichd conducts and supports research in the united states and throughout the world on fetal infant and child development maternal child and family health reproductive biology and population issues and medical rehabilitation for more information visit about the national institutes of health nih nih the nations medical research agency includes 27 institutes and centers and is a component of the us department of health and human services nih is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases for more information about nih and its programs visit wwwnihgov nihturning discovery into health blood test may identify gestational diabetes risk in first trimester

real,maywood il robotic surgery is as effective as traditional open surgery in treating bladder cancer according to a landmark study published in the journal lancet three loyola medicine urologists marcus quek md gopal gupta md and alex gorbonos md are coauthors of the study first author is dipen parekh md of the university of miami loyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders after two years there was no significant difference between the two groups in survival without disease progression robotic surgery was associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stays but longer surgeries there were no significant differences in complication rates or in patients quality of life the study is called razor randomized open versus robotic cystectomy trial and was funded by the national cancer institute a robotic system allows a surgeon to perform operations through a few small incisions movements by the surgeons hand or wrist are translated into highly precise movements of the surgical instruments every maneuver is directed by the surgeon in real time as the surgeon views a magnified 3d highdefinition image of the surgical site since robotic surgery was introduced in 2000 it has spread rapidly and has been used in about four million surgeries worldwide but apart from the razor trial there have been no prospective randomized multicenter trials to assess how robotic surgery compares to open surgery in cancer survival the razor trial found that two years after surgery 723 percent of patients in the robotic surgery group were alive with no disease progression and essentially cured compared with 716 percent in the open surgery group sixtyseven percent of robotic surgery patients experienced adverse effects such as urinary tract infections and intestinal obstructions compared with 69 percent in the open surgery group robotic surgery patients stayed a median of six days in the hospital compared with seven days in the open surgery group robotic surgery patients lost less than half as much blood as open surgery patients but spent more time in the operating room seven hours eight minutes compared with six hours one minute researchers wrote that the findings underscore the need for further highquality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice dr gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach it is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy removal of the prostate he said
real,longterm followup of participants in clinical trials of a generic vaccine to reverse advanced type 1 diabetes finds significant clinical benefits including restoration of nearnormal blood sugar levels three years after receiving two administrations of the bacillus calmettegurin bcg vaccine four weeks apart all members of a group of adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed an improvement in hba1c to near normal levels improvement that persisted for the following five years the study from a massachusetts general hospital mgh research team published in npj vaccines also reports that the effects of bcg vaccine on blood sugar control appear to depend on a totally novel metabolic mechanism that increases cellular consumption of glucose this is clinical validation of the potential to stably lower blood sugars to near normal levels with a safe vaccine even in patients with longstanding disease says denise faustman md phd director of the mgh immunobiology laboratory principal investigator of bcg clinical trials at mgh and senior author of the npj vaccines report in addition to the clinical outcomes we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited bcg vaccine doses can make permanent beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes faustman will also present fiveyear followup results of a separate group of bcg clinical trial participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes on saturday june 23 at the 78th scientific sessions of the american diabetes association in orlando used for almost a century to prevent tuberculosis bcg has been known for more than 30 years to boost production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor tnf which may be beneficial in autoimmune diseases both by eliminating the autoreactive t cells that attack an individuals tissues in the case of type 1 diabetes pancreatic islets and by inducing production of regulatory t cells tregs that could prevent an autoimmune reaction faustmans team first reported in 2001 that inducing tnf production could cure type 1 diabetes in mice but since tnf dosing is toxic in humans clinical trials have utilized bcg for its ability to elevate tnf levels safely initial clinical trial results published in a 2012 plos one paper reported that two doses of bcg spaced four weeks apart led to reductions in autoreactive t cells an increase in tregs and what turned out to be a transient increase in insulin production but by the end of that short 20week trial there was no reduction in hba1c the established measure of blood sugar levels over time an extension and expansion of that trial with long term followup the current results are based on data from 282 human study participants 52 with type 1 diabetes who participated in the bcg clinical trials and 230 who contributed blood samples for mechanistic studies regular monitoring of clinical trial participants found that hba1c levels of those receiving bcg had dropped by more than 10 percent at three years after treatment and by more than 18 percent at four years that reduction was maintained over the next four years with treated participants having an average hba1c of 665 close to the 65 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis and with no reports of severe hypoglycemia participants in the placebo group and in a comparison group of patients receiving no treatment experienced consistent hba1c elevations over the same eightyear time period in investigating how bcg administration produces its beneficial effects the research team identified a mechanism never previously seen in humans in response to treatment with any drug a shifting of the process of glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy to aerobic glycolysis a process that involves significantly greater glucose consumption by cells the researchers also found that bcg could reduce blood sugar elevations in mice that were caused by means other than autoimmune attack raising the possibility that bcg vaccines could also be beneficial against type 2 diabetes mihai g netea phd professor in the department of internal medicine at radboud university medical center in the netherlands says of this study the clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the bcg vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system we know and this study shows that bcg vaccination induces epigenetic reprogramming at the chromatin architecture level and functional alterations indicative of a permanent change in immunity the mgh trials and other larger prevention and intervention trials underway around the globe may lead to a major shift in the prevention and treatment of infections and autoimmunity netea was not involved in the current study
real,a new study authored by scientists from the american cancer society the harvard th chan school of public health the us national cancer institute and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin d concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk this study strengthens the evidence previously considered inconclusive for a protective relationship optimal vitamin d concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current national academy of medicine recommendations which are based only on bone health the study appears online in the journal of the national cancer institute vitamin d known for its role in maintaining bone health is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25hydroxyvitamin d the accepted measure of vitamin d status are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer the few randomized clinical trials of vitamin d supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect but study size supplementation duration and compliance may have contributed to their null findings to address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin d and to investigate associations in population subgroups we analyzed participantlevel data collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies said stephanie smithwarner phd an epidemiologist at the harvard th chan school of public health and cosenior author on the article the analysis included over 5700 colorectal cancer cases and 7100 controls from the united states europe and asia a single widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin d measurements and calibration of existing vitamin d measurements in the past substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin d data from different studies explained regina g ziegler phd a national cancer institute epidemiologist and cosenior author on the article this calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin d levels seen internationally compared to participants with circulating vitamin d concentrations considered sufficient for bone health those with deficient concentrations of vitamin d had a 31 higher risk of colorectal cancer during followup which averaged 55 years range 1 25 years similarly concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22 lower risk however risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations these associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined however the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 42 1 in 24 in women and 45 1 in 22 in men colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in both men and women in the united states with about 140250 new cases and 50630 deaths expected during 2018 currently health agencies do not recommend vitamin d for the prevention of colorectal cancer said marji l mccullough scd american cancer society epidemiologist and cofirst author of the study this study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin d guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention vitamin d can be obtained in the diet particularly from fortified foods from supplements and from sun exposure experts recommend vitamin d be obtained through diet whenever possible because excessive ultraviolet radiation is a major risk factor for skin cancer
real,titusville nj june 14 2018 prnewswire the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson johnson today announced results from the mercury pe study which showed that people with lowrisk pulmonary embolism pe treated with xarelto rivaroxaban and discharged from the emergency department had significantly reduced time in the hospital and a median savings of 2496 in per patient costs compared to standard of care inpatient treatment results from mercury pe which evaluated the benefits of treating patients with lowrisk pe with xarelto and discharging them early from the emergency department to complete treatment at home were published in academic emergency medicine click to tweet new study shows outpatient use of janssen bloodthinner results in cost savings and reduces time in hospital for lowrisk pe patients every year us health care systems spend more than two billion dollars to manage patients with pulmonary emboli said principal study investigator w frank peacock md facep facc associate chair and research director emergency medicine baylor college of medicine houston tx by avoiding hospitalizations that are not clinically necessary and transitioning patients with lowrisk pe to outpatient treatment with xarelto weve seen significant cost savings which could help alleviate the burden on health care systems venous thromboembolism vte includes deep vein thrombosis dvt a blood clot in a deep vein and pe a potentially lifethreatening condition that occurs when a blood clot travels to the lung of the approximately 900000 americans who experience a vte each yeari more than 250000 are diagnosed with pe in the emergency departmentii hospitals across the united states have varying protocols for managing pe but standard of care typically requires people to be admitted for treatment which drives up costs and substantially increases hospitalacquired conditions and infectionsiiiiv while people with more severe pe have higher mortality rates the 30day mortality rate of lowrisk pe is less than one percentv click to tweet patients taking janssen blood thinner say in a new study that outpatient treatment is less burdensome than the standard of care mercury pe met its primary efficacy endpoint with xarelto leading to significantly reduced time in the hospital due to vte or bleeding within 30 days after randomization compared with the standard of care mean duration of 48 vs 336 hours respectively 95 ci p<00001 the mean difference of length of stay between the two groups was 288 hours of note there was no recurrence of vte or vterelated death or any significant differences in the bleedingrelated hospitalizations or physician visits within 90 days from randomization in either group though this outcome should be interpreted with caution as the study was significantly underpowered to detect any such differences were proud to have pioneered this groundbreaking research which was the first prospective randomized trial to confirm the benefit of discharging patients with lowrisk pe early from the hospital and completing treatment at home said paul burton md phd facc vice president janssen scientific affairs llc we expect that this xarelto study will prompt physicians to reconsider how patients with lowrisk pe are managed about mercurype patients with lowrisk pe were randomly assigned in a 11 ratio to open label xarelto or standard of care within 12 hours of diagnosis patients randomized to xarelto were discharged from the emergency department within 24 hours and were instructed to take xarelto 15 mg twice daily for 21 days then xarelto 20 mg once daily until the study was completed patients randomized to standard of care were treated per local hospital protocol which could include hospitalization and any us food and drug administrationapproved anticoagulant strategy including xarelto researchers also made the following observations about xarelto in this setting the mean length of initial and subsequent hospitalizations for any reason was shorter for patients who were discharged early on xarelto within 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care p0024 192 hours vs 432 hours respectively within 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care p0024 192 hours vs 432 hours respectively there was no major bleeding in either group within 90 days from randomization although two patients reported clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding one in each group there were no deaths due to bleeding in the study overall early discharge on xarelto was markedly less expensive than standard of care the cost associated with the emergency room visit and any subsequent hospitalization at the time of pe diagnosis and the total costs were 2638 p<0001 and 2496 p<0001 less with xarelto mercury pe builds on prior research including a june 2015 study published in academic emergency medicine showing that 106 patients with lowrisk pe or dvt when prescribed xarelto and immediately discharged had no recurrent events while on therapy additionally no major or clinically relevant bleeding events were observed a companion study found patients with lowrisk pe or dvt who were prescribed xarelto had significantly lower medical costs than those admitted and given standard treatment the clinical and economic benefits demonstrated in the mercurype trial have been confirmed in more than 3100 us patients in a realworld study showing that xarelto resulted in a significant oneday reduction in hospital length of stay and significantly lower total healthcare costs approximately 2000 mercury pe patient satisfaction results patient satisfaction both with outpatient and inpatient care was also analyzed using likert scales and the anticlot treatment score acts on the likert scales most patients in both groups indicated they were very satisfied with their care but numerically more patients taking xarelto preferred to receive outpatient care 50 percent compared to slightly less than half of patients receiving inpatient standard of care 475 percent the acts measured the patients perspective on the burden of treatment with more patients taking xarelto reporting it was not at all burdensome compared to those receiving standard of care 644 percent vs 544 percent about mercury pe mercury pe was a randomized open label parallelgroup multicenter trial conducted at 35 hospitals across the us adult patients who arrived at the emergency department with confirmed lowrisk pe defined by the absence of any hestia criteria were eligible for enrollment of the 114 patients randomized 99 completed the study 44 in the xarelto group and 55 in the standard of care group patients who did not complete the study were mainly lost to followup or adverse events analyses were conducted by intentiontotreat basis regardless of the anticoagulant used the primary efficacy outcome was the total amount of time spent in the hospital in hours for vte or bleeding events in the 30 days after randomization hospital readmissions for reasons unrelated to vte were excluded the primary safety outcome was major bleeding within 90 days secondary efficacy endpoints included 90day rates of newrecurrent vte vterelated death unplanned hospital or physician office visits for vte or bleeding total length of initial or subsequent hospitalizations for any reason patientreported satisfaction and total costs of care a secondary safety endpoint was clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding based on international society on thrombosis and haemostasis isth definitions mercury pe also had a few limitations including sample size study enrolled 114 of a planned 300 patients exclusion bias based on subjective evaluation of hemodynamic stability and ability to adhere to protocol and potential bias due to inability to blind patients to their admission status about explorer mercury pe is part of the explorer program which is unmatched by any oral anticoagulant in the factor xa inhibitor class in its size scope and ambition a collaborative effort between janssen and its development partner bayer explorer seeks to generate important clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of xarelto and its potential role in addressing critical unmet medical needs a number of the studies in the program are designed to seek additional indications or expand the label for

annual meeting until now there have been few treatment advances for squamous nonsmallcell lung cancer our findings may provide a new potential treatment option for this type of cancer said lead study author robert m jotte md phd medical director and cochair uson thoracic committee rocky mountain cancer centers in denver co we used to think that chemotherapy just knocked down the patients immune system and that it would be irrational to combine it with immunotherapy but growing research including this study shows that chemotherapy can help trigger the immune response to the tumor helping the immunotherapy treatment work better squamous nsclc which accounts for 2530 of nsclcs is very difficult to treat fewer than 15 of people with advanced squamous nsclc survive a year after diagnosis and less than 2 survive five years recent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in nonsquamous lung cancer given those findings along with the results from this trial a rapid change in clinical practice is expected noted dr jotte about the study the impower131 trial enrolled 1021 patients with stage iv squamous nsclc tumors were tested for pdl1 expression but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor pdl1 expression level patients with egfr or alk gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial the study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups outcomes for only two of the groups however are being reported in this presentation atezolizumab plus chemotherapy carboplatin and nabpaclitaxel 343 patients chemotherapy carboplatin and nabpaclitaxel 340 patients outcome data for the third treatment group which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen carboplatin and paclitaxel are not yet available key findings in this study 29 of all patients regardless of pdl1 expression had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone importantly there was a doubling of progressionfree survival pfs benefit with this combination at 12 months cancer had not worsened in 247 patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy compared to 12 of those receiving chemotherapy alone improved progressionfree survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy including those with pdl1negative tumors and liver metastases overall survival data are not yet mature this is the first phase iii trial of an immunotherapybased combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progressionfree survival in advanced squamous nsclc according to the authors although the difference between treatment groups is modest a statistically significant improvement shows that overall people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment according to the authors although the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone 68 vs 57 it had a manageable safety profile consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies the most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash colitis and low thyroid hormone at this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival os benefit was not observed median os was 14 months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs 139 months for chemotherapy alone researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year next steps more research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy the researchers will explore tumor pdl1 expression and other molecular markers such as tumor mutational burden tmb that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen this study received funding from f hoffmannla roche ltd study at a glance

real,toronto may 22 2018 a nonsurgical procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention pci along with prescribed medication is better than medication alone as initial treatment for people who have the most common form of heart disease suggests an analysis of an international clinical trial coled by st michaels hospital published today in the new england journal of medicine and simultaneously presented at europcr 2018 in paris france the fiveyear analysis of the fame 2 trial shows that initial pci along with medication was associated with a significant reduction in urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations to restore blood flow in the blood vessels of the heart and a likely reduction in heart attacks as compared to medication as the only treatment the medication used in the fame 2 trial consisted of a combination of aspirin cholesterollowering and blood pressurelowering drugs as required by current treatment guidelines pci is a minimallyinvasive procedure where modern stents small tubular metal scaffolds coated with medication are inserted into an artery using a small catheter to widen a narrowed blood vessel in the heart pci is commonly used to treat sudden blockages of a coronary artery that cause a heart attack in situations where the hearts arteries narrow less suddenly and do not cause a heart attack but induce chest pain during exercise a condition known as stable coronary artery disease it has remained unclear whether pci in addition to medication was better than medication alone in preventing future heart attacks currently the standard practice in north america is to prescribe medication to patients with stable coronary artery disease and avoid pci said dr peter jni director of the applied health research centre ahrc at the li ka shing knowledge institute of st michaels hospital who is a senior author on the study our results pose the question would a large portion of patients benefit from early pci in addition to medication we used pressure measurements inside the heart arteries to find coronary arteries that should be widened said dr bernard de bruyne an interventional cardiologist at the cardiovascular center aalst in belgium and the principal investigator of the trial with these measurements we were able to identify patients who would benefit from pci in addition to medication the world health organization reports that every year 177 million people die from cardiovascular diseases which is an estimated 31 per cent of all deaths worldwide coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in north america and europe and is a serious health problem worldwide it occurs when the coronary arteries become narrow and hardened due to the buildup of cholesterol rich plaques in the blood vessels while the fame 2 trial showed that pci reduced urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations and likely reduced heart attacks it did not provide evidence for a difference between pci and medication alone in the prevention of deaths the trial was initially sponsored by st jude medical a global medical device company until the threeyear followup the subsequent two years of followup have been academically driven organized the by the academic steering committee of the study nineteen sites across europe and north america participated in the fiveyear followup our trial over its entire followup shows us that the longer you observe these patients the more pronounced the benefits of the initial pci become said dr jni who is also a canada research chair and a professor of medicine at the university of toronto while drs jni and de bruyne agree there is more research to be done using modern pci technology this fiveyear followup offers evidence that pci has the potential to provide longterm benefits to patients with stable coronary artery disease

real,results of a recent study to better understand modifiable factors such as physical activity that may affect a womans ability to conceive a child suggest that walking may help women to improve their chances of becoming pregnant amherst mass results of a recent study to better understand modifiable factors such as physical activity that may affect a womans ability to conceive a child suggest that walking may help women to improve their chances of becoming pregnant the study was conducted by recent graduate lindsey russo and her advisor brian whitcomb associate professor of biostatistics and epidemiology in the school of public health and health sciences at the university of massachusetts amherst russo and whitcombs findings among healthy women ages 18 to 40 years old with a history of one or two pregnancy losses are based on their secondary analysis of the multisite effects of aspirin in gestation and reproduction eager study it is led by enrique schisterman of the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development results are in the current online issue of human reproduction russo says one of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses except for walking which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese whitcomb whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level adds lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level what we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health so this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about further he says we were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity this is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability for the 1214 women in the study the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant known as fecundability varied significantly by body mass index the authors report among overweightobese women walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability further in statistically adjusted models women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity moderate activity sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in bmistratified analyses they add russo and whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and lowintensity activities whitcomb says we dont know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking but our study doesnt offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels among a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways russo says we did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically the researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without whitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study the eager trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses however he adds we were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address the researchers conclude that these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy especially for walking among those with higher bmi further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms through which walking and vigorous activity might affect timetopregnancy

real,titusville nj may 5 2018 prnewswire the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson johnson today announced the results from two phase 3 clinical studies of the investigational compound esketamine nasal spray in patients with treatmentresistant depression these studies will be presented at the american psychiatric association annual meeting taking place may 59 in new york ny data from a study in adults with treatmentresistant depression showed that flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated a statistically significant clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms as compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant the study defined treatmentresistant as patients who had not responded to two or more currently available antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression data from a second study in elderly patients aged 65 and older with treatmentresistant depression which is the first study of its kind showed treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated clinically meaningful effects compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant however the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint if approved by the us food and drug administration fda esketamine would be one of the first new approaches to treat refractory major depressive disorder available to patients in the last 50 years with about 30 percent of patients with major depression failing to respond to currently available antidepressants1 treatmentresistant depression represents a major public health need said husseini k manji md global head neuroscience therapeutic area janssen research development llc the positive phase 3 results for esketamine nasal spray in adults with treatmentresistant depression are exciting particularly as they mark the first time an antidepressant has achieved superiority versus an active comparator in any clinical trial for major depressive disorder what makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatmentresistant we are also pleased with the clinically meaningful outcomes for esketamine nasal spray in elderly patients a population that often has greater disability and lower response rates theres a critical need for new rapidly acting and effective treatment options for people with major depressive disorder who do not respond to

real,a new device worn like a visor can detect emergent largevessel occlusion in patients with suspected stroke with 92 percent accuracy report clinical investigators at the medical university of south carolina musc mount sinai the university of tennessee health sciences center and elsewhere in an article published online on march 6 2018 in the journal of neurointerventional surgery patients with largevessel occlusions can then be routed to a comprehensive stroke center with endovascular capabilities in contrast a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with largevessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy the volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy vips device cerebrotech visortm cerebrotech medical systems pleasanton ca works by sending lowenergy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device when a patient is having a severe stroke the brains fluids will change producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the vips device the greater the asymmetry the more severe the stroke endovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent largevessel occlusion but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment the researchers hope that the device will save valuable time especially important in stroke where time is brain when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field this is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first according to raymond d turner md professor of neurosurgery and chief of the neuroscience integrated center of clinical excellence at musc turner served as principal investigator for musc in the vips for the noninvasive detection of hemispheric bioimpedance asymmetry in severe brain pathology vital study reported in the article transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time said turner if we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a largevessel occlusion that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to in the study the vips device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five comprehensive stroke centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat largevessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the prehospital acute stroke severity scale both healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the vips device three readings were taken and averaged a process that takes about 30 seconds patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging compared to the neurologists diagnoses the device displayed 92 percent specificity the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology this places the vips device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent the vips device is made by cerebrotech medical systems which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently the neuroimaging data was needed to teach the vips device which radio waves were indicative of stroke yet the consultants did not have access to the vips radio wave data during their review of the images thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the devices accuracy it is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants as metal interferes with the devices operating radio frequencies the devices success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke the vips device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis in their next steps the researchers are undertaking the vital 20 study to determine if the vips device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists if so the vips device could have widespread clinical implications helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment turner likens the use of the vips device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography ecg to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction he predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces this could potentially be something like a defibrillator said turner you can find out if a patient is having a stroke just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient

real,a novel risk assessment tool helps identify which patients undergoing total hip replacement may be at higher risk for an implant dislocation after surgery according to a new study from researchers at nyu langone health and described in the best poster in the adult reconstruction hip at the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons aaos 2018 annual meeting in new orleans more than 310000 hip replacements are performed in the united states each year and an estimated 25 million americans are currently living with hip replacements in a hip replacement an artificial joint comprising a ball and socket is implanted to replace the natural ball and socket in the pelvis enabling movement that is typical of the hip joint while dislocations only occur in about 1 percent of patients after hip replacement certain individuals may be at a higher risk nyu langone research presented at last years aaos annual meeting showed that spinal deformity was a significant risk factor for dislocation and subsequent revision surgery the researchers reported at the time how the lumbar spine or lower back moves during posture changes like transitioning from sitting to standing creating alterations in socalled spinopelvic relationship which changes position of the hip socket and may cause an implant to dislocate in a person with spinal deformity this led researchers to further develop a risk prediction tool to better identify which patients undergoing a hip replacement may be at higher risk for dislocation and then implement a treatment algorithm to help reduce that risk dislocation is a common reason for a total hip replacement to fail and when it happens sufferers can experience significant pain and require another surgery to fix the problem explains lead study author jonathan vigdorchik md an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at nyu school of medicine and associate fellowship director of the division of adult reconstructive surgery at nyu langone orthopedic hospital orthopedic surgeons need to be more aware of this problem and think about the risk of dislocation prior to performing a hip replacement instead of just dealing with the complications after the surgery we need to be proactive in our approach what the study found some newer hip implants are designed with dual mobility cups that allow for increased range of motion which helps reduce dislocation risk however no guidelines currently exist to aid clinicians in deciding when to use these more flexible implants which are often more expensive than conventional implants may not be medically necessary and may carry added risks if implanted unnecessarily for the study researchers reviewed data on 1082 total hip replacements performed using computer navigation between january 2014 and december 2015 during which period no dualmobility implants were used the overall implant dislocation rate among this cohort was found to be 18 percent of this group 320 patients had spinal disease and deformity as evidenced by imaging scans and of them 10 experienced dislocations suggesting a dislocation rate of 31 percent for highrisk patients or about three times higher than normal beginning in 2016 surgeons used the standardized risk prediction model and treatment algorithm developed at nyu langone which factored in data collected from preoperative imaging taken while the patient was sitting and standing and other measures that might affect risk for dislocation including presence of a previous lumbar fusion using the risk assessment tool the researchers identified 192 of 1009 patients as high risk for a dislocation after surgery all 192 patients underwent a total hip replacement through the highrisk algorithm with dual mobility implants being used in 143 of the cases the researchers reported only one dislocation in this highrisk group or 05 percent of highrisk patients compared with 31 percent in the previous group not assessed with the risk assessment and treatment algorithm these findings represent a sixfold decrease in the rate of dislocation in the highrisk group there were significantly fewer dislocations in the highrisk group once all of our patients were analyzed through our new treatment algorithm explains study coauthor aaron j buckland md an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery in the division of spine surgery and director of spine research at nyu langone we were able to stop these implant dislocations from occurring in the first place sparing our patients followup care and the need for revision surgery all patients who undergo hip replacement at nyu langone orthopedic hospital now go through the risk assessment screening and treatment algorithm prior to surgery other technologies including laserguidance computer navigation and robotic surgical devices are used for the especially highrisk and complex cases identified through the algorithm in order to ensure the best possible outcome free of complications
real,a new study has shown how the bodys immune system responds to the new shingles vaccine shingrix making it more than 90 effective at protecting against the virus the trial included more than 15000 participants across 18 countries in europe north america latin america asia and australia participants in the trial received two doses of the vaccine with the doses given two months apart lead researcher professor tony cunningham from the westmead institute for medical research said the study shows that the vaccine stimulates production of a specific immune memory cell cd4 t cells generating a strong and sustained protection against the virus the body has two types of immunity protein antibodies and white blood cells known as t cells as the virus circulates around the body antibodies block it from entering cells but when the virus does get into cells your t cells try to kill those infected cells our research shows that the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce more antibodies and it generates a 24fold increase in t cells this is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines the research published in the journal of infectious diseases shows that shingrix offers protection for up to four years but professor cunningham believes it will last much longer the second dose of the vaccine is important to ensure longterm protection professor cunningham said the efficacy is approximately 90 for all age groupseven for those over 70 years of age this is quite remarkable because there are no other vaccines that perform nearly so well for people in their 70s and their 80s we are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations whats particularly exciting though is that 90 of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3year duration of the study we anticipate that this protection will actually last much much longer we are now measuring the efficacy of the vaccine over the next 10 years and are very optimistic about the results he said shingrix is different from most other vaccines many vaccines are made from a weakened form of the virus but shingrix is made from just a single proteinknown as glycoprotein ethat comes from the outer shell of the herpes zoster virus the vaccine also contains an adjuvanta substance that helps your body fight off the virus it is the first shingles vaccine to combine a nonlive antigen with a specifically designed adjuvant shingles is a viral infection caused by the herpes zoster virusthe same virus that causes chickenpox the incidence of shingles increases as we get older because the bodys natural immunity declines when people reach their 50s and 60s t cell immunity declines allowing shingles to strike thats why our adult vaccine is directed specifically at t cell immunity professor cunningham said most australian adults have been infected with the herpes zoster virus and are at risk of shingles even if they do not remember having chicken pox by age 85 approximately 50 of the population will develop shingles vaccination is the only way to protect against shingles
real,a treatment that improves the lives of nearly 13 million people with rheumatoid arthritis might one day originate from scorpion venom a group of researchers led by dr christine beeton at baylor college of medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments the study appears in the journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease one in which the immune system attacks its own body in this case it affects the joints said beeton associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and member dan l duncan comprehensive cancer center at baylor college of medicine cells called fibroblastlike synoviocytes fls play a major role in the disease as they grow and move from joint to joint they secrete products that damage the joints and attract immune cells that cause inflammation and pain as damage progresses the joints become enlarged and are unable to move current treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for fls beeton and her colleagues studied fls looking for an achilles heel that would allow them to prevent or stop them from damaging the joints in previous work we identified a potassium channel on fls of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that the channel was very important for the development of the disease beeton said we wanted to find a way to block the channel to stop the cells damaging the joints potassium channels work by opening gates on the surface of cells that allow potassium ions small charged atoms to flow in and out of the cell the flow of ions through the channels is necessary for the cells to carry out many of their essential functions animals such as scorpions have venoms that block potassium and other ion channels they use the venoms to paralyze and kill prey decades ago scientists discovered this and realized that if handled correctly venoms also might have medicinal applications scorpion venom may lead to improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis scorpion venom has hundreds of different components one of the components in the venom of the scorpion called buthus tamulus specifically blocks the potassium channel of fls and not the channels in other cells such as those of the nervous system said first author dr mark tanner a graduate student in the beeton lab during the development of this project here we investigated whether this venom component called iberiotoxin would be able to specifically block the fls potassium channel and reduce the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis in rat models of the disease when the researchers treated rat models of the disease with iberiotoxin they stopped the progression of the disease in some cases they reversed the signs of established disease meaning that the animals had better joint mobility and less inflammation in their joints in addition treatment with iberiotoxin did not induce side effects such as tremors and incontinence observed when treating with another channel blocker called paxilline it was very exciting to see that iberiotoxin is very specific for the potassium channel in fls and that it did not seem to affect the channels in other types of cells which might explain the lack of tremors and incontinence tanner said although these results are promising much more research needs to be conducted before we can use scorpion venom components to treat rheumatoid arthritis beeton said we think that this venom component iberiotoxin can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future
real,dallas feb 26 2018 a lactoovovegetarian diet which includes eggs and dairy but excludes meat and fish and a mediterranean diet are likely equally effective in reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke according to new research in the american heart associations journal circulation previous separate studies have shown that a mediterranean diet reduces certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease as does a vegetarian diet however this was the first study to compare effects of the two distinct eating patterns current study authors said they wanted to evaluate whether switching to a lactoovovegetarian diet would also be hearthealthy in people who were used to eating both meat and fish to best evaluate this issue we decided to compare a lactoovovegetarian diet with a mediterranean diet in the same group of people said francesco sofi md phd lead study author and professor of clinical nutrition at the university of florence and careggi university hospital in italy the study included 107 healthy but overweight participants ages 1875 who were randomly assigned to follow for three months either a lowcalorie vegetarian diet which included dairy and eggs or a lowcalorie mediterranean diet for three months the mediterranean diet included poultry fish and some red meat as well as fruits vegetables beans and whole grains after three months the participants switched diets most participants were able to stay on both diets researchers found participants on either diet lost about 3 pounds of body fat lost about 4 pounds of weight overall and experienced about the same change in body mass index a measure of weight in relationship to height authors said they did find two differences between the diets that may be noteworthy the vegetarian diet was more effective at reducing ldl the bad cholesterol while the mediterranean diet resulted greater reductions in triglycerides high levels of which increase the risk for heart attack and stroke still the takehome message of our study is that a lowcalorie lactoovovegetarian diet can help patients reduce cardiovascular risk about the same as a lowcalorie mediterranean diet sofi said people have more than one choice for a hearthealthy diet in an editorial accompanying the study cheryl a m anderson phd mph ms an associate professor of preventive medicine at the university of california san diego in california wrote that there were similarities between the two diets that may explain the results both follow a healthy dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables legumes beans whole grains and nuts focusing on diet variety nutrient density and appropriate amount of food and limiting energy intake from saturated fats anderson who was not involved in the study added that promoting both diets by healthcare professionals offer a possible solution to the ongoing challenges to prevent and manage obesity and cardiovascular diseases study limitations include the fact that participants were at relatively low risk of cardiovascular disease anderson said future research should compare the diets in patients at higher risk for heart disease and should also explore whether or not healthful versions of traditional diets around the world that emphasize fresh foods and limit sugars saturated fats and sodium can prevent and manage obesity and cardiovascular diseases
real,for immediate release february 13 2018 the us food and drug administration today permitted marketing of the first blood test to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury mtbi commonly referred to as concussion in adults the fda reviewed and authorized for marketing the banyan brain trauma indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its breakthrough devices program most patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale called the 15point glasgow coma scale followed by a computed tomography or ct scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage or intracranial lesions that may require treatment however a majority of patients evaluated for mtbiconcussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a ct scan availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a ct scan in patients suspected of having mtbi and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients helping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an fda priority todays action supports the fdas initiative to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure from medical imagingan effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam at the right time with the right radiation dose said fda commissioner scott gottlieb md a bloodtesting option for the evaluation of mtbiconcussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases in addition availability of a blood test for mtbiconcussion will likely reduce the ct scans performed on patients with concussion each year potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests according to the us centers for disease control and prevention in 2013 there were approximately 28 million tbirelated emergency department visits hospitalizations and deaths in the us of these cases tbi contributed to the deaths of nearly 50000 people tbi is caused by a bump blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brains normal functioning its severity may range from mild to severe with 75 percent of tbis that occur each year being assessed as mtbis or concussions a majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative ct scan potential effects of tbi can include impaired thinking or memory movement sensation or emotional functioning a blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the american public and for our service members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests said jeffrey shuren md director of the fdas center for devices and radiological health the fdas review team worked closely with the test developer and the us department of defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mtbi that can be used both in the continental us as well as foreign us laboratories that service the american military the brain trauma indicator works by measuring levels of proteins known as uchl1 and gfap that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury levels of these blood proteins after mtbiconcussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by ct scan and which wont being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a ct scan test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours the fda evaluated data from a multicenter prospective clinical study of 1947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mtbiconcussion and reviewed the products performance by comparing mtbiconcussion blood tests results with ct scan results the brain trauma indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a ct scan 975 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a ct scan 996 percent of the time these findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a ct scan in at least onethird of patients who are suspected of having mtbi the brain trauma indicator was reviewed under the fdas de novo premarket review pathway a regulatory pathway for some low to moderaterisk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device the fda is permitting marketing of the brain trauma indicator to banyan biomarkers inc the fda an agency

real,los angeles jan 25 2018 clot removal may be beneficial up to 24 hours following stroke in carefully selected patients but every hour delayed after symptoms begin may be associated with more disability according to preliminary research presented at the american stroke associations international stroke conference 2018 a world premier meeting dedicated to the science and treatment of cerebrovascular disease for researchers and clinicians the international dawn trial previously demonstrated that patients with a small area of irreversible brain damage and a large area of brain at jeopardy of being lost if the clot remains are more likely to recover with minimal disability if the clot is removed up to 24 hours after symptoms begin or were noticed it is already wellestablished that the benefit of clot removal declines each hour during the first 6 hours after symptoms are detected in the current analysis of treatment between 6 and 24 hours after symptoms were observed or after the person was last seen to be well researchers found each 1hour delay reduces the chance of recovery with minimal or no disability by 11 percent and treatment remains beneficial through 24 hours with patients who had their clots removed being 355 percent more likely to have minimal or no disability 90 days later but the overall effect of treatment declines with time the current results demonstrate the importance of prompt imaging and treatment of patients with clotcaused stroke even in those who wake up having experienced a stroke or who for other reasons are not identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms
real,a scientifically based approach that includes a toothdecay risk assessment aggressive preventive measures and conservative restorations can dramatically reduce decay in community dental practices according to a study by researchers at uc san francisco the findings which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting have the potential to transform dental care for highrisk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices results appear online jan 22 2018 in advances in dental research we put the 2012 ucsf clinical study into the real world and showed it works said lead author peter rechmann dmd phd professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences in the ucsf school of dentistry the patients at high caries risk who used prescription products went down significantly over time in their risk level those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree simply by using overthecounter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria dental caries tooth decay is caused by bacteria on the tooth surface feeding on carbohydrates then making acids as waste these acids destroy the protective tooth enamel and the dentin layer beneath it if not halted or reversed this leads to a cavity caries management by risk assessment cambra is an evidencebased approach to preventing or treating dental caries at its earliest stages it was launched in 2003 through the ucsf school of dentistry by the papers senior author john featherstone phd msc former dean of the school and distinguished professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences a dentist who uses cambra obtains the patients dental and medical history and conducts a clinical exam to assess caries early enough to reverse or halt progression and to determine caries risk factors these factors include among other things acidproducing bacteria frequent eating and drinking of fermentable carbohydrates snacking and abnormally low saliva flow and function from this assessment the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors the treatment plan typically incorporates remineralization through the use of fluoride andor antibacterial therapies such as chlorhexidine and xylitol minimally invasive restorative procedures to conserve tooth structure and regular patient follow up the authors published their initial validation of cambra for ages 6 through adult in 2006 followed by several additional years of data published in 2011 2012 2015 and 2016 since then more than half of the us schools and colleges of dentistry have adopted cambra in one form or another as part of their standard curriculum the authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a nonacademic clinical setting there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse cambra and other preventive therapies for adults thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices treatment effective even without prescription products in the advances in dental research study rechmann and his colleagues recruited 20 dentists 17 in private practice three in community clinics to participate in a twoyear cambra trial of 460 patients ages 1265 years old with 239 in a cambra group and 221 in a control group in the cambra group highrisk patients received prescription fluoride toothpaste chlorhexidine antibacterial rinse xylitol mints and fluoride varnish the control group received regular fluoride toothpaste an assumed inactive mouth rinse sorbitol candies and a nonfluoride varnish followup visits occurred at six 12 18 and 24 months in which new caries lesions or changes in caries risk level were recorded overall the researchers found that a significantly greater percentage of highrisk participants were classified at lower risk after receiving cambra preventive therapies dental decay was low in both groups among 242 patients 137 intervention 105 control initially identified as high risk for caries only a quarter of the patients remained at high risk in the cambra group at 24 months while just over half 54 percent of the control group did of the 192 lowrisk participants 93 intervention 99 control most participants remained low risk indicating that the assessment correctly identifies who is at risk for caries the researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects while not as significant as the cambra group in this study the risk level of these patients dropped more dramatically over time than for those in the 2012 ucsf cambra study it was surprising to see the benefits gained by the control group rechmann said more research is needed to see if the products and treatment administered to this group function in the way we speculate and if so they might be made easily available to dental patients doing so can change the whole picture of caries control among the study limitations the researchers noted a high study attrition 65 percent which partly may have contributed to observed declines in risk level at each subsequent recall visit
real,patients gave universally positive feedback about the apps ease of use and the ability to have wounds monitored chicago jan 19 2017 a new smartphone app called woundcare is successfully enabling patients to remotely send images of their surgical wounds for monitoring by nurses the app was developed by researches from the wisconsin institute of surgical outcomes research wisor department of surgery university of wisconsin madison with the goal of earlier detection of surgical site infections ssis and prevention of hospital readmissions the study results appear as an article in press on the website of the journal of the american college of surgeons ahead of print ssis are the most common hospitalacquired infection and the leading cause of hospital readmission following an operation123 due to the prevalence off ssis the wisor research team decided to see if postoperative wound monitoring could be effectively achieved by having patients upload photos through the woundcare app and answer a few brief questions to gather information not easily captured through images patients cannot identify infections and frequently ignore or fail to recognize the early signs of cellulitis or other wound complications study authors wrote this drawback leads to the common and frustrating scenario where patients present to a routine scheduled clinic appointment with an advanced wound complication that requires readmission with or without reoperation however the complication may have been amenable to outpatient management if detected earlier forty vascular surgery patients were enrolled in the study there was an overall data submission rate of 902 percent among participants and submissions were reviewed within an average of 97 hours during the study seven wound complications were detected and one false negative was found we set out to come up with a protocol where patients could become active participants in their care and allow us to be in closer communication and monitor their wounds after they leave the hospital said lead study author and general surgery resident rebecca l gunter md this approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis patients were enthusiastic about the apps ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored the nurse practitioners responsible for reviewing the submitted images attested to the value of the photos and patient satisfaction although they also noted it was difficult to find time to review the submitted images on top of an already heavy clinical workload study authors note that the success and sustainability of a postdischarge woundmonitoring protocol requires a dedicated transitional care program and not simply adding a task to the current staff workload this protocol also has a costsavings component in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects study authors note that ssis are the most expensive hospitalacquired infection costing an average of nearly 30000 per woundrelated readmission and an estimated 310 billion annually if you could imagine saving the cost from the number of patients whose readmission you were able to prevent that result could provide significant savings to the health system dr gunter said although capturing specific numbers related to costsavings was not part of this study dr gunter said it is an important area of focus for future studies a limitation to telemedicine protocols that call for the use of smartphones is that not every patient has the necessary technology or knowledge to upload images on their own the wisor research team addressed this issue by having participants undergo tailored training to learn to use the woundcheck app they provided each patient with an iphone 5s and an accompanying visual reference guide to further assist in using the phone and app dr gunter said they were very successful in giving patients knowledge and access to technology so they could participate in the study she said this is a model easily adaptable to other medical centers whether through providing participants with a phone having a rotating supply of phones at the hospitals for patients to borrow or relying on a patients personal device we have demonstrated that a population of complex and highrisk patients many of whom are older adults and novice smartphone users can complete this protocol with high fidelity and satisfaction the researchers concluded

real,dallas jan 8 2018 exercise can reverse damage to sedentary aging hearts and help prevent risk of future heart failure if its enough exercise and if its begun in time according to a new study by cardiologists at ut southwestern and texas health resources to reap the most benefit the exercise regimen should begin by late middle age before age 65 when the heart apparently retains some plasticity and ability to remodel itself according to the findings by researchers at the institute for exercise and environmental medicine ieem which is a collaboration between ut southwestern medical center and texas health presbyterian hospital dallas and the exercise needs to be performed four to five times a week two to three times a week was not enough the researchers found in an earlier study based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past 5 years this dose of exercise has become my prescription for life said senior author dr benjamin levine director of the institute and professor of internal medicine at ut southwestern i think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower the regimen included exercising four to five times a week generally in 30minute sessions plus warmup and cooldown one of the weekly sessions included a highintensity 30minute workout such as aerobic interval sessions in which heart rate tops 95 percent of peak rate for 4 minutes with 3 minutes of recovery repeated four times a socalled 4 x 4 each interval session was followed by a recovery session performed at relatively low intensity one days session lasted an hour and was of moderate intensity as a prescription for life levine said this longer session could be a fun activity such as tennis aerobic dancing walking or biking one or two other sessions were performed each week at a moderate intensity meaning the participant would break a sweat be a little short of breath but still be able to carry on a conversation the talk test in the study exercise sessions were individually prescribed based on exercise tests and heart rate monitoring one or two weekly strength training sessions using weights or exercise machines were included on a separate day or after an endurance session study participants built up to those levels beginning with three 30minute moderate exercise sessions for the first 3 months and peaked at 10 months when two highintensity aerobic intervals were added the more than 50 participants in the study were divided into two groups one of which received two years of supervised exercise training and the other group a control group which participated in yoga and balance training at the end of the twoyear study those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25 percent improvement in compliance or elasticity of the left ventricular muscle of the heart dr levine noted he compared the change in the heart to a stretchy new rubber band versus one that has gotten stiff sitting in a drawer sedentary aging can lead to a stiffening of the muscle in the hearts left ventricle the chamber that pumps oxygenrich blood back out to the body he explained when the muscle stiffens you get high pressure and the heart chamber doesnt fill as well with blood in its most severe form blood can back up into the lungs thats when heart failure develops said dr levine who holds the s finley ewing chair for wellness at texas health dallas and the harry s moss heart chair for cardiovascular research he also holds the distinguished professorship in exercise sciences at ut southwestern which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year earlier research by ut southwestern cardiologists showed that left ventricular stiffening often shows up in middle age in people who dont exercise and arent fit leaving them with small stiff chambers that cant pump blood as well however the researchers also found that the heart chamber in competitive masterslevel athletes remains large and elastic and that even four to five days of committed exercise over decades is enough for noncompetitive athletes to reap most of this benefit in the current study researchers wanted to know if exercise can restore the hearts elasticity in previously sedentary individuals especially if begun in late middle age previous studies from dr levines research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65 to start the study researchers recruited 53 participants ages 45 to 64 many came from the dallas heart study which includes 6000 dallas residents and is the only singlecenter heart study of its size and multiethnic composition the dallas heart study is designed to improve the diagnosis prevention and treatment of heart disease
real,providence ri brown university new results from a clinical trial involving more than 900 military veterans at high risk for keratinocyte carcinoma skin cancer provides evidence that using the generic skin cream fluorouacil 5 percent for two to four weeks may reduce the risk of a squamous cell carcinoma scc needing surgery by 75 percent within a year the finding that less than one months use of fluorouacil 5 5fu appeared to prevent cancer for up to a year is encouraging said lead author dr martin a weinstock a professor of dermatology in the warren alpert medical school of brown university and chief of dermatology at the providence veterans affairs medical center the dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis in a 2015 study weinstock and coauthors showed the up to fourweek regimen of 5fu had a multiyear preventive benefit in reducing the number of actinic keratosis ak and the need for treatment earlier this year they also showed that the medicine prevents new aks from emerging for two to three years meanwhile current means for preventing new carcinomas in highrisk patients sunscreen or oral medications cease to work as soon as they are no longer used but in the new study 5fu appeared to provide prolonged protection after discontinuation and could be combined with sunscreen weinstock said in the absence of such a longlasting prevention option he said the typical approach to caring for patients with a history of prior carcinomas is to monitor for the next cancer and then remove it surgically an effective but imposing strategy often called wait and cut people dont appreciate having stuff cut on their face a lot said weinstock who led the trial funded by the us department of veterans affairs and conducted at a dozen va hospitals around the country they do it if there is a cancer there but we want to take a proactive approach where we can give them something to reduce their risk of getting new cancers the new results are published in jama dermatology the vakcc trial between 2009 and 2013 the veterans affairs keratinocyte carcinoma chemoprevention trial randomly assigned 932 veterans who each had at least two prior basal cell carcinomas bccs or sccs to either receive the 5fu cream or a cream just like it but without the active ingredient as an experimental control all of the veterans were instructed to apply their cream twice a day to their face and ears for up to four weeks they also received a 30 spf sunscreen and received education about skin cancer sunscreen and sun safety the two groups were both almost exclusively white and male and they averaged 71 years of age the experimental and control groups were very similar along all other measured characteristics including their self reported degree of prior sun exposure and sunburn veterans typically have spent a large amount of time in the sun during their years of service both groups went to their va center twice a year for two to four years for followup exams with a dermatologist neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5fu and who received the placebo some reduced risks after the first year 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5fu did a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk according to the study for the subsequent three years there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an scc for bccs there was an 11 percent reduced risk after the first year among the group that received 5fu but that difference was not statistically significant in the second year bcc cases requiring surgery rose in the 5fu group but in years three and four and by the end of the study there was no significant overall difference in risk of developing a bcc requiring surgical treatment after four years 298 of all study the participants had developed at least one bcc and 108 had developed at least one scc the study did show a significant decrease in the risk of needing mohs surgery to treat a bcc in the first year mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure weinstock said in the studys first year 36 bccs were treated with mohs surgery in 27 participants in the control group but only 17 bccs were treated with the procedure among 14 patients in the 5fu group this suggests that using the 5fu can reduce the resources needed to treat these carcinomas weinstock said the cream does have common side effects including reddened more sensitive and often crusty skin effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops weinstock acknowledged after the studys first six months 21 percent of the 5fu group rated the side effects as severe and 40 percent rated them as moderate but after six months and again at the end of the fouryear trial 87 percent of participants in the 5fu group said theyd be willing to repeat the treatment if it proved effective in reducing skin cancer in his clinical work weinstock said that for particularly highrisk patients he has recommended 5fu treatment based on the study results it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year the most remarkable thing about this study is that now we have something to use that doesnt lose its effectiveness when you stop using it weinstock said but this is the first study of its type im hopeful there will be other studies that show other sorts of regimens that last longer and do a better job over time as science progresses this is an important first step he and colleagues are planning further studies including one to determine the costeffectiveness of 5fu treatment
real,augusta ga jan 2 2018 in just four months highdoses of vitamin d reduce arterial stiffness in young overweightobese vitamindeficient but otherwise still healthy africanamericans researchers say rigid artery walls are an independent predictor of cardiovascular related disease and death and vitamin d deficiency appears to be a contributor says dr yanbin dong geneticist and cardiologist at the georgia prevention institute at the medical college of georgia at augusta university so researchers looked at baseline and again 16 weeks later in 70 africanamericans ages 1345 all of whom had some degree of arterial stiffness taking varying doses of the vitamin best known for its role in bone health in what appears to be the first randomized trial of its kind they found that arterial stiffness was improved by vitamin d supplementation in a doseresponse manner in this population they write in the journal plos one overweightobese blacks are at increased risk for vitamin d deficiency because darker skin absorbs less sunlight the skin makes vitamin d in response to sun exposure and fat tends to sequester vitamin d for no apparent purpose says dong the studys corresponding author participants taking 4000 international units more than six times the daily 600 ius the institute of medicine currently recommends for most adults and children received the most benefit says dr anas raed research resident in the mcg department of medicine and the studys first author the dose now considered the highest safe upper dose of the vitamin by the institute of medicine reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest 104 percent in four months it significantly and rapidly reduced stiffness raed says two thousand ius decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe at 600 ius arterial stiffness actually increased slightly 1 percent and the placebo group experienced a 23 percent increase in arterial stiffness over the timeframe they used the noninvasive gold standard pulse wave velocity to assess arterial stiffness reported measures were from the carotid artery in the neck to the femoral artery a major blood vessel which supplies the lower body with blood the american heart association considers this the primary outcome measurement of arterial stiffness when the heart beats it generates a waveform and with a healthy heart and vasculature there are fewer and smaller waves the test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving and in this case fast is not good raed says when your arteries are more stiff you have higher pulse wave velocity which increases your risk of cardiometabolic disease in the future says raed the varying doses as well as the placebo participants took were all packaged the same so neither they or the investigators knew which dose if any they were getting until the study was complete both placebo and supplements were given once monthly rather than daily at home at the gpi to ensure consistent compliance dong was also corresponding author on a study published in 2015 in the journal biomed central obesity that showed in this same group of individuals both 2000 and 4000 ius restored more desirable vitamin d blood levels of 30 nanograms per milliliter the 4000 upperlimit dose restored healthy blood level quicker by eight weeks and was also better at suppressing parathyroid hormone which works against vitamin ds efforts to improve bone health by absorbing calcium they reported while heart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states according to the centers for disease control and prevention blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death than whites and the disease tends to occur earlier in life the authors write that arterial stiffness and vitamin d deficiency might be potential contributors while just how vitamin d is good for our arteries isnt completely understood it appears to impact blood vessel health in many ways laboratory studies have shown that mice missing a vitamin d receptor have higher activation of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system says raed activation of this system increases blood vessel constriction which can contribute to arterial stiffness vitamin d also can suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation activation of garbageeating macrophages and calcification formation all of which can thicken blood vessel walls and hinder flexibility vitamin d also reduces inflammation an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease says raed now its time to do a largerscale study particularly in highrisk populations and follow participants progress for longer periods dong and raed say a year would give us even more data and ideas raed adds dong notes that pulse wave velocity and blood pressure measures are complimentary but not interchangeable we think maybe in the future when you go to your physician he or she might check your arterial stiffness as another indicator of how healthy you are raed says there were no measurable differences in weight or blood pressure measurements over the 16week study period the institute of medicine currently recommends a daily intake of 800 ius of vitamin d for those age 70 and older for adolescents and adults they recommend 4000 ius as the upper daily limit 2000 was a previous upper limit more than 80 percent of americans the majority of whom spend their days indoors have vitamin d insufficiency or deficiency dong an expert in vitamin d and a professor in the mcg department of population health sciences says about 15 minutes daily in the young sun between 10 am and 2 pm but before your skin starts to get pink is the best source of vitamin d foods like milk milk products like cheese and yogurt fatty fish like mackerel and sardines some greens like kale and collards and fortified cereals also are good sources the researchers say a vitamin d supplement is an inexpensive and safe option for most of us
real,community screening for osteoporosis could prevent more than a quarter of hip fractures in older women according to new research a new study published in the lancet has shown that a simple questionnaire combined with bone mineral density measurements for some would help identify those at risk of hip fracture the research involving more than 12000 older women and carried out in collaboration between the universities of birmingham east anglia bristol leicester york and sheffield found that screening through gp practices allowed patients to be targeted for treatment in women agreeing to participate this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years professor neil gittoes of the university of birminghams institute of metabolism and systems research said our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures which is particularly relevant in our ageing society the consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating including impaired mobility and loss of independence while we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening we are also exploring costeffectiveness of this approach initial analyses also look promising in this respect professor lee shepstone from ueas norwich medical school said approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime in the uk around 536000 people suffer fragility fractures each year including 79000 hip fractures a hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery mortality at oneyear postfracture is approximately 20 per cent we wanted to find out whether screening like screening for breast cancer could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture the team used a university of sheffield developed tool called frax which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture a hip spine upper arm or lower arm fracture to identify older women at high risk a total of 12483 women aged 7085 were recruited from 100 gp practices in seven regions birmingham bristol manchester norwich sheffield southampton and york half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care among those screened treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture this recommendation was acted upon by the women and their gps so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening while screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosisrelated fractures there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures in the screening group there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group the study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be costeffective professor shepstone added this is the first trial to show that a communityscreening approach based on the frax fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population the results of this study potentially have important public health implications professor eugene mccloskey of the university of sheffield said lowcost screening with frax among the older population could result in effective targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures if the scoop screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all uk women aged 7085 years we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the uk even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study the randomised controlled trial screening for osteoporosis in older women for the prevention of fracture scoop was funded by the medical research council and arthritis research uk dr natalie carter head of research liaison and evaluation at arthritis research uk said ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the uk as well as significantly increasing mortality a hip fracture can stop a persons ability to live independently with 43 no longer being able to walk independently in the year after the fracture we welcome this community based screening programme and any other research that reduces the likelihood of fractures

real,standard guidelines for stroke treatment currently recommend clot removal only within six hours of stroke onset but a milestone study with results published today in the new england journal of medicine shows that clot removal up to 24 hours after stroke led to significantly reduced disability for properly selected patients the international multicenter clinical study known as the dawn trial randomly assigned 206 stroke victims who arrived at the hospital within six to 24 hours to either endovascular clot removal therapy known as thrombectomy or to standard medical therapy thrombectomy involves a catheter placed in the femoral artery and snaked up the aorta and into the cerebral arteries where the clot that is blocking the artery and causing the neurological symptoms is retrieved almost half of the patients 486 percent who had clot removal showed a considerable decrease in disability meaning they were independent in activities of daily living 90 days after treatment only 131 percent of the medication group had a similar decrease there was no difference in mortality or other safety endpoints between the two groups these findings could impact countless stroke patients all over the world who often arrive at the hospital after the current sixhour treatment window has closed says coprincipal investigator raul nogueira md professor of neurology neurosurgery and radiology at emory university school of medicine and director of neuroendovascular service at the marcus stroke neuroscience center at grady memorial hospital when the irreversibly damaged brain area affected by the stroke is small we see that clot removal can make a significant positive difference even if performed outside the sixhour window says coprincipal investigator tudor jovin md director of the university of pittsburgh medical center stroke institute however this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the er in the event of a stroke the mantra time is brain still holds true to select patients for the trial the researchers used a new approach which used brain imaging and clinical criteria as opposed to just time alone looking at the physiological state of the brain and evaluating the extent of tissue damage and other clinical factors seems to be a better way to decide if thrombectomy will benefit patients as opposed to adhering to a rigid time window says nogueira the researchers planned to enroll a maximum of 500 patients over the course of the study period however a preplanned interim review of the treatment effectiveness after 200 patients were enrolled in the trial led the independent data safety monitoring board overseeing the study to recommend early termination of the trial based on predefined criteria demonstrating that clot removal provided significant clinical benefit in the studied patients our research and clinical teams are immensely proud of these breakthrough findings which are so profound they will likely result in a paradigm shift that will not be seen again for many years in the field of stroke therapeutics says michael frankel md professor of neurology emory university school of medicine chief of neurology and director of the marcus stroke and neuroscience center for the grady health system according to frankel the emory neuroscience team was a major contributor to the dawn trial working at grady memorial hospital the second leading site of the trials enrollment the dawn trial included trial locations in the united states spain france australia and canada the trial was sponsored by stryker corporation a medical technology company that manufactures the clot removal devices used in the study the dawn trial results were presented at the european stroke organization conference in may
real,a new paper in the journal of the national cancer institute finds that testing for cervical cancer using hpv testing in addition to the pap smear is unlikely to detect cancer cases that wouldnt be found using hpv testing alone the main goal of cervical screening programs is to detect and treat precancer before cancer develops cytologybased screening known as the pap test or pap smear is used to detect abnormal cells the pap test can also find noncancerous conditions such as infections and inflammation cervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years following introduction of testing for the dozen highrisk human papillomavirus hpv types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors despite more research into hpv and the introduction of preventive hpv vaccines screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come but improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion even controversy hpv testing is more sensitive than the pap test for detecting precancer the hpv test captures the known cancer causing viruses but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the pap smear plus hpv testing however reports of rare hpvnegative paptestpositive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests cotesting despite increased testing costs an hpv test in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of hpv is more sensitive than the pap test a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells for detection of precancers thus if a single screening method were chosen to complement hpv vaccination primary hpv testing likely would gradually supplant the pap test in the us an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary hpv testing every three years the same as the pap test alternatively current guidelines recommend cotesting but in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the pap test alone the screening interval is extended to every five years draft guidelines from the us preventive services task force recently recommended either primary hpv testing every five years or the pap test every three years for women 30 to 64 and did not recommend cotesting the accumulated evidence supports inclusion of hpv testing in screening thus the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary hpv testing alone researchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the pap test component of cotesting as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial in january 2003 just prior to us fda approval of hpv and pap test cotesting in mid2003 and interim guidelines in 2004 kaiser permanente northern california a large integrated health care organization introduced threeyear cotesting in women aged 30 years and older kaiser permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting this remains the most extensive experience of hpv testing incorporated into routine screening in the world researchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with hpv testing alone at kaiser permanente where 1208710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003 screening histories preceding cervical cancers n623 and precancers n5369 were examined to assess the relative contribution of the pap test and hpv test components in identifying cases the analysis found that hpv testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the pap test hpv testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point except within 12 months hpvnegative pap testpositive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer 35 and cancer 59 these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases given the rarity of cancers among screened women the contribution of the pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year twothirds 679 of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of followup at kaiser permanente were detected by the first cotest performed the researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus hpv alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women

real,weight training or cardio for older adults trying to slim down pumping iron might be the way to go a new study by researchers at wake forest university suggests combining weight training with a lowcalorie diet preserves much needed lean muscle mass that can be lost through aerobic workouts the findings effect of exercise type during intentional weight loss on body composition in older adults with obesity appear in the november issue of the journal obesity a lot of older adults will walk as their exercise of choice said kristen beavers assistant professor of health and exercise science at wake forest and lead author of the study but this research shows that if youre worried about losing muscle weight training can be the better option in this 18month study of 249 adults in their 60s who were overweight or obese restricting calories plus resistance training in the form of weightmachine workouts resulted in less muscle loss but significant fat loss when compared to weight loss plus walking or weight loss alone losing weight is generally recommended for those with obesity but preserving muscle while losing fat is particularly important for older adults in order to maximize functional benefit beavers said surprisingly we found that cardio workouts may actually cause older adults with obesity to lose more lean mass than dieting alone loss of lean mass could have important consequences given the high risk of physical disability among the growing population of older adults the findings total fat loss was much greater when participants combined diet plus walking about 16 pounds and diet plus weight training about 17 pounds diet alone resulted in about 10 pounds of fat lost over 18 months muscle mass loss was greatest with diet plus walking about 4 pounds compared with diet alone or diet plus weight training each about 2 pounds put another way the percentage of weight loss coming from muscle mass was 20 in the weight loss plus walking group 16 in the weight loss alone group and 10 in the weight loss plus weight training group loss of fat was associated with faster walking speed while loss of muscle was associated with reduced knee strength these results may be even more important for older adults who gain and lose weight with frequency because seniors typically dont regain muscle they regain fat mass which is all the more reason for older adults to try and preserve muscle mass during weight loss beavers said this is the latest study from the cooperative lifestyle intervention program clipii a singleblind randomized controlled trial the participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups a weightlossonly group who followed a calorierestricted diet with no exercise regimen a weight loss plus cardio ie walking group and a weight loss plus weighttraining group
real,newswise women who need breast surgery to remove an abnormality that cannot be felt also known as a nonpalpable breast lesion now may benefit from the convenience and comfort provided by an advanced new tissue locating technology offered at rush university medical center the savi scout radar localization system helps to decrease the time a woman is in the operating room increase the success rates of lesion removal and reduce the amount of healthy breast tissue that is removed during the procedure rush began offering savi scout which has been used in more than 50 lumpectomy surgeries in july savi scout allows a radiologist to insert a radar wave reflector the size of a grain of rice in the patients breast up to 30 days before surgery to mark the location of the lesion as shown with ultrasound or xray mammography the reflector replaces the widespread current practice of inserting a thin hooked wire into the breast the same day as surgery when there is an abnormality that we cant feel and are unable to biopsy we have to find that lesion in surgery said dr andrea madrigrano assistant professor of surgery at rush university medical center savi scout replaces a more inconvenient technique used since 70s used since the 1970s a hooked wire is placed in the breast through the skin to the abnormality using ultrasound or xray guidance with local anesthesia the wire is placed into the breast to help guide the surgeon in removing the abnormality later that day until now a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast the woman would then be taken to the operating room area madrigrano said wire localization requires a high degree of coordination between radiology and surgical scheduling which can lead to delays between placement of the wire and surgery often requiring a woman to wait long periods of time with the wire in her breast before surgery these patients are in a hospital gown and are walking around while this wire is in place which obviously is less than ideal for the patient madrigrano said the radar reflector is a replacement for the wire and is essentially a little marker after the patient receives a local anesthetic it can be placed into the breast using an extremely thin needle under image guidance days or weeks prior to surgery because this important step is out of the way in advance it completely changes the patients day of surgery experience radar can target abnormality within 1 mm sparing more healthy tissue unlike mastectomy which treats breast cancer by removing an entire breast lumpectomy surgery also known as breastconserving surgery is used to remove only the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding the tumor using the savi scout system technology which emits 50 million radar pulses per second surgeons can target the affected tissue within 1 millimeter of the reflector when madrigrano told me about it i thought it was an ingenious idea and im glad it was developed said nancy morrissey who underwent lumpectomy surgery at rush in july using the savi scout technology it made surgery go smoothly and i didnt have any pain before or after when the marker was inserted near the lump it was similar to a biopsy i was glad it was done a week before and not the same day as the lumpectomy surgery i have been very impressed with the experience according to cianna medical the company that created savi scout 70 percent of women return to work the next day after the scout procedure in addition to enhancing the patients surgical experience the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better that advantage may lead to less tissue needing to be removed and a better appearance of the breast after surgery ultimately this wireless technology has the potential to reduce surgical delays and more importantly will benefit patients by increasing comfort and satisfaction during a stressful time madrigrano said using radar to make breast surgery easier for women

real,characterized by the world health organization as a neglected tropical disease leprosy also known as hansens disease is one of the most ancient diseases known to humankind and is caused by the bacteria mycobacterium leprae nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage while drug therapy exists for leprosy it must be taken for many months has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection a viable vaccine to prevent andor treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end scientists at idri along with national and international collaborators including the national hansens disease program and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid part of the national institutes of health with financial support from american leprosy missions have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities based on data generated in preclinical studies the vaccine candidate called lepvax has progressed to phase i clinical testing in the united states the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers the clinical trial is focused on safety as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine while previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve said steven reed phd idri president ceo founder the leprosy vaccine program at idri has benefited greatly from what weve learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges this vaccine represents a unique accomplishment requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology and american leprosy missions has been there from the beginning idri scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis both in clinical stages of development we are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over 51 million made possible by our faithful donors and partners a leprosyspecific vaccine is beginning a phase i clinical trial says bill simmons president and ceo of american leprosy missions we believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multidrug therapy the current treatment for leprosy was launched in the 1980s we look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy and it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together what a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide the vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying m leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response idri scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins which is combined with idris proprietary immunestimulating adjuvant glase with recent developments in vaccine technology idri scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium this generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research the development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory reed explained this is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods reed added that without the foresight and support of american leprosy missions there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate the vision and support of american leprosy missions has been tremendous as weve worked with them throughout the years moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine he said the progress weve had to date would not have been possible without american leprosy missions financial support and guidance early results from the phase i study should be available in 2018 and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through laterphase clinical trials should results from the phase i study clinical trial nct03302897 support further evaluation the vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy which will require detection prevention and treatment idri had developed technology to enable a rapid affordable pointofcare diagnostic test which was funded by niaid grant numbers 1r43ai06661301a1 and 2r44ai06661302 in addition to idri and

real,in a remarkably rapid translation of laboratory research findings into a treatment with the potential to benefit patients uc san francisco scientists have successfully completed a phase ii clinical trial showing that an fdaapproved antihistamine restores nervous system function in patients with chronic multiple sclerosis ms in light of previous laboratory studies of the antihistamine compound at ucsf the researchers said the drug most likely exerted its effect by repairing damage ms had inflicted on myelin an insulating membrane that speeds transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system the drug tested in the trial clemastine fumarate was first identified as a candidate treatment for ms in 2013 by ucsfs jonah r chan phd debbie and andy rachleff distinguished professor of neurology vice chief of the division of neuroinflammation and glial biology and senior author of the new study first approved by the us food and drug administration fda in 1977 for allergies the drug has been available over the counter in generic form since 1993 the researchers said that the phase ii results published online on 10 october 2017 in the lancet are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a therapy has been able to reverse deficits caused by ms its not a cure but its a first step towards restoring brain function to the millions who are affected by this chronic debilitating disease said the trials principal investigator ari green md also debbie and andy rachleff distinguished professor of neurology chief of the division of neuroinflammation and glial biology and medical director of the ucsf multiple sclerosis and neuroinflammation center chan and green are codirectors of the ucsf smallmolecule program for remyelination and both are members of the ucsf weill institute for neurosciences the new results are particularly notable chan said because patients in the trial had suffered from ms symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years people thought we were absolutely crazy to launch this trial because they thought that only in newly diagnosed cases could a drug like this be effective intuitively if myelin damage is new the chance of repair is strong in the patients in our trial the disease had gone on for years but we still saw strong evidence of repair ms is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 25 million people worldwide the disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin layers of fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers unlike the rubber insulation around wires however myelin helps electrical signals in neurons move faster and more efficiently as myelin damage continues over the course of the disease neurons progressively lose their ability to reliably transmit electrical signals resulting in progressive loss of vision weakness walking difficulties and problems with coordination and balance current ms treatments aim to prevent the immune system from doing further harm but none have been shown to repair damaged myelin in both his 2013 research and in subsequent studies with a mouse model of ms however chan and colleagues had demonstrated that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin regeneration and restores neural function promising preclinical results that inspired the new study known as the rebuild trial because the visual system is often one of the first and most prominent parts of the brain to be affected in ms and because there are wellestablished tools to measure the speed of neural transmission in the areas of the brain devoted to vision the research team used a method known as visual evoked potentials or veps to assess clemastines therapeutic effects in the trial the fivemonth phase ii trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally longstanding ms whose veps reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission the researchers showed flickering patterns on a screen to participants and used electrodes placed over the brains visual areas at the back of the head to gauge how long it took for the flickering signal presented to the eye to generate an electrical response that could be detected by the electrodes the time from presentation of the pattern to the detection of the vep is a measurement of how long it took for the signal to travel via nerve fibers from the retina at the back of the eye to the visual areas at the back of the brain to enhance the power of their study the researchers used a crossover design they divided the patient population in two and gave the drug blinded to both participant and researcher to one group and a placebo to the other for 90 days then they switched between the two groups giving a placebo to the first group and the drug to the other for the next 60 days this flipflop technique gave the researchers the ability to compare patients to themselves a form of control that increased the statistical power of the study by nearly an order of magnitude green said during the periods when each group was taking the drug the neural signal from the eye to the back of the brain was significantly accelerated over the baseline measurements taken before the patients began the study the effect persisted in the group that had switched to placebo suggesting that durable repair of myelin had been induced by the drug although the research team could not directly observe evidence of rebuilding of myelin in trial participants using magnetic resonance imaging mri chan and green said that this reflects a weakness of current mri techniques as a tool for this purpose rather than evidence that myelin regeneration did not take place we still dont have imaging methods that have been proven to be able to detect remyelination in humans said chan that myelin increases the speed of neural transmission is one of the most wellestablished concepts in neurobiology and combined with the clear evidence from chans preclinical research showing that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin formation myelin regeneration is the only plausible explanation for the vep results the authors said this is the first step in a long process green said by no means do we want to suggest that this is a cureall we want to groundtruth myelination metrics were designing the crucible thats going to be used to test any future method for detecting remyelination
real,widely available ibuprofen is a better choice for pain relief in children who have undergone minor orthopedic outpatient surgery as it has fewer adverse effects compared with oral morphine according to results from a clinical trial published in cmaj canadian medical association journal this result suggests that adequate pain management should be an important goal of care even after minor outpatient surgery and that more effective pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies should be explored writes dr naveen poonai clinician scientist lawson health research institute and associate professor emergency medicine department of paediatrics schulich school of medicine dentistry western university with coauthors the study included 154 children aged 5 to 17 years who underwent minor orthopedic surgery such as keyhole surgery on joints ligament and tendon repair suture or hardware removal at london health sciences centre in london ontario in the first 24 hours more than 80 of the children in the study needed pain relief at home pain scores for children in both the oral morphine and ibuprofen groups were similar but the children receiving oral morphine reported more adverse effects such as nausea vomiting drowsiness dizziness and constipation morphine did not provide superior analgesia but was associated with significantly more adverse effects making ibuprofen a better analgesic option write the authors they note that as neither treatment completely relieved pain more research is needed into effective pain relief especially for more severe pain oral morphine use at home has not been previously studied in children who have had minor surgery nor has it been compared with ibuprofen
real,multivitamins in pregnancy may be linked to lower autism risk in children evidence not yet sufficient to change practice but findings warrant further investigation say researchers taking multivitamins during early pregnancy may be associated with a reduced risk of autism spectrum disorder asd in children compared with mothers who do not take multivitamins finds a study published in the bmj today the researchers stress that their findings cannot establish cause and effect but say they raise questions about a possible association that warrant further investigation autism spectrum disorder asd includes a range of conditions including asperger syndrome that affect a persons social interaction communication interests and behaviour its estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the uk has asd more boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls research indicates that asd most likely develops in the womb and that a mothers diet during pregnancy could have an influence but results from previous studies have been inconsistent suggesting that other unmeasured factors confounding such as a mothers overall health and lifestyle could also play a role so an international research team set out to assess whether nutrient supplementation during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of asd with and without intellectual disability they applied three analytical methods to a sample of 273107 motherchild pairs living in stockholm sweden the sample was restricted to children who were 4 to 15 years of age by december 31 2011 and were born between 1996 and 2007 women reported their use of folic acid iron and multivitamin supplements at their first antenatal visit and cases of child asd were identified from national registers after adjusting for several potentially influencing factors in both mothers and children the researchers found that multivitamin use with or without additional iron andor folic acid was associated with a lower likelihood of child asd with intellectual disability relative to mothers who did not use folic acid iron and multivitamins there was no consistent evidence that either iron or folic acid use were associated with a reduced risk of asd the results of the various analyses seemed to be consistent with each other say the authors suggesting that the association between multivitamins and asd might not be fully explained by confounding they point to several study limitations such as the potential for confounding and difficulty assessing type timing and dose of supplements however strengths included the relatively large populationbased sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings together the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with asd with intellectual disability say the authors given the current understanding and strength of evidence supporting the importance of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy it is impossible to imagine that these results on their own should change current practice they write however they say these findings raise questions that warrant investigation and call for verification in randomised studies before recommending a change to current practice ends notes to editors research antenatal nutritional supplementation and autism spectrum disorders in the stockholm youth cohort population based cohort study journal the bmj multivitamins in pregnancy may be linked to lower autism risk in children

real,for the first time scientists have precisely identified and targeted an area of the brain which is involved in hearing voices experienced by many patients with schizophrenia they have been able to show in a controlled trial that targeting this area with magnetic pulses can improve the condition in some patients this early clinical work is presented at the ecnp conference in paris on tuesday 5th september with later publication in schizophrenia bulletin this is the first controlled trial to precisely determine an anatomically defined brain area where high frequency magnetic pulses can improve the hearing of voices said lead researcher professor sonia dollfus university of caen chu france schizophrenia is a serious longterm mental health problem people with schizophrenia experience a range of symptoms which may include delusions muddled thoughts and hallucinations one of the bestknown is hearing voices also known as auditory verbal hallucination avh which around 70 of people with schizophrenia experience at some point these voices may be heard as having a variety of different characteristics for example as internal or external friendly or threatening they may be continuously present or present only occasionally and so on transcranial magnetic stimulation tms has been suggested as a possible way of treating the hearing of voices in schizophrenia tms uses magnetic pulses to the brain and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions however there is a lack of controlled trials to show that tms works effectively with avh sufferers the french research team worked with 26 patients who received active tms treatment and 33 as a control group who received sham placebo treatment the researchers interviewed the patients using a standard protocol the auditory hallucinations rating scale which revealed most of the characteristic features of the voices which they were hearing the treated patients received a series of 20 hz highfrequency magnetic pulses over 2 sessions a day for 2 days using magnetic resonance imaging mri the pulses were targeted at a specific brain area in the temporal lobe which is associated with language the exact area is the crossing of the projection of the ascending branch of the left lateral sulcus and the left superior temporal sulcus after 2 weeks the patients were reevaluated the researchers found that 346 of the patients being treated by tms showed a significant response whereas only 91 of patients in the sham group responded significant response was defined as a more than 30 decrease in the total auditory hallucinations rating scale score professor sonia dollfus said auditory verbal hallucinations or hearing voices can be a disturbing symptom of schizophrenia both for patients and for those close to sufferers this is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency tms this means two things firstly it seems that we now can say with some certainty that we have found a specific anatomical area of the brain associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia secondly we have shown that treatment with high frequency tms makes a difference to at least some sufferers although there is a long way to go before we will know if tms is the best route to treat these patients in the longterm commenting professor andreas meyerlindenberg central institute of mental health mannheim and member of the ecnp executive board said this work builds on previous studies that have shown a critical role of excessive activity of subregions of the temporal lobe in the generation of voice hallucinations in schizophrenia to move this into treatment controlled trial such as the one by dollfus and coworkers are important while response rates were moderate tms is a welcome addition to the therapeutic repertoire especially for patients who do not respond to medication note the full title of this release is scientists discover brain area which can be targeted for treatment in patients with schizophrenia who hear voices it has been shortened in some versions to comply with eurekalert title limits this work has been accepted in the peerreviewed journal schizophrenia bulletin the journal of psychoses and related disorders the exact publication date has still to be determined note around 220000 people have been diagnosed as having schizophrenia in england and wales www rcpsych ac uk pdf nas20national20report20final pdf

real,washingtona new dietary review of 49 observational and controlled studies finds plantbased vegetarian diets especially vegan diets are associated with lower levels of total cholesterol including lower levels of hdl and ldl cholesterol compared to omnivorous diets the metaanalysis appears as an online advance in nutrition reviews the study authorsyoko yokoyama phd mph susan levin ms rd cssd and neal barnard md faccreviewed 30 observational studies and 19 clinical trials which met their inclusion criteria they find a plantbased vegetarian diet is associated with total cholesterol thats 292 mgdl lower in observational studies in clinical trials a plantbased diet lowers total cholesterol by 125 mgdl in observational studies a plantbased vegetarian diet is associated with a 229 mgdl reduction in ldl cholesterol and a 36 mgdl reduction in hdl cholesterol compared to control groups following an omnivorous diet in clinical trials a plantbased vegetarian diet lowers ldl cholesterol by 122 mgdl and reduces hdl cholesterol by 34 mgdl compared to control groups following an omnivorous lowfat calorierestricted or a conventional diabetes diet a plantbased vegetarian diet is not associated with statistically significant changes in triglyceride levels in observational studies or in clinical trials the authors predict the strong correlation between vegetarian diets and lower cholesterol levels may be due to the association a plantbased diet has with a lower body weight a reduced intake of saturated fat and an increased intake of plant foods like vegetables fruits legumes nuts and whole grains which are naturally rich in components such as soluble fiber soy protein and plant sterols the study authors hypothesize that the greater risk reduction for total hdl and ldl cholesterol levels observed in the longitudinal studies is likely due to longterm adherence to plantbased eating patterns and changes in body composition the immediate health benefits of a plantbased diet like weight loss lower blood pressure and improved cholesterol are well documented in controlled studies says study author susan levin ms rd cssd our goal with studying plasma lipids throughout the lifespan is to capture the net risk reduction of using a vegetarian diet to control lipid levels we hope to empower patients with new research about the longterm cardiovascular health benefits of a vegetarian diet which include a reduced risk of a heart attack stroke and premature death charles ross do a member of the nonprofit physicians committee and a former emergency department physician has firsthand experience with putting a plantbased diet into practice dr ross is in his late 60s takes no medications and lowered his previously high total cholesterol from 230 mgdl to a healthy 135 mgdl after adopting a wholefood plantbased diet in 2012 within the first month of making the dietary change he effortlessly lost 10 pounds within a year dr ross traded a 34year career of practicing emergency medicine for a new career path lifestyle medicine after 55 years of making the career switch he continues to host free biweekly nutrition classes for his primary care patients and the community more than 700 people have enrolled to learn how to lose weight eliminate the need for medications to treat type 2 diabetes hypertension and elevated cholesterol and to simply feel better his former hometown of roseburg ore is now a blue zones community he is a parttime instructor at the college of osteopathic medicine of the pacific northwest and hopes to set an example for future physicians i no longer work for a living notes dr ross who now resides in westfir ore i wake up every day eager to hear about how a plantbased diet and a healthful lifestyle is changing and saving lives in our community what ive found is that if you want your patients to make significant health changes you have to make them yourself the prescription started to spread soon after my family coworkers neighbors and friends heard about my experience for clinicians concerned about spending extra time in and outside of the exam room the study authors encourage timestrapped health care providers to refer patients to registered dietitians who can help with the transition to a plantbased vegetarian diet the 2015 dietary guidelines for americans highlights a healthy vegetarian diet as one of three healthful eating plans to follow the study authors also note hyperlipidemia or elevated cholesterol and triglycerides is often underdiagnosed and undertreated a 10 percent increase in the prevalence of treatment for hyperlipidemia can prevent 8000 deaths each year taking small steps like those proposed by the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel 3 which include assessing heart disease risk making lifestyle and dietary recommendations and assessing the need for future followup appointments and pharmaceutical interventions could prevent approximately 20000 heart attacks 10000 cases of coronary heart disease and save almost 3 billion in medical costs each year to make any form of health care work and to truly power economic mobility we have to get

noninvasively in living patients using a retinal scan with high resolution this clinical trial is reinforced by an indepth exploration of the accumulation of betaamyloid in the retina of alzheimers patients versus matched controls and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies findings from this study strongly suggest that retinal imaging can serve as a surrogate biomarker to investigate and monitor alzheimers disease said maya koronyohamaoui phd an associate professor of neurosurgery and biomedical sciences and a research scientist at the maxine dunitz neurosurgical institute at cedarssinai and a cofounder inventor and scientist at neurovision she is the senior leading author of an article in jci insight published online aug 17 as a developmental outgrowth of the central nervous system that shares many of the brains characteristics the retina may offer a unique opportunity for us to easily and conveniently detect and monitor alzheimers disease said keith l black md chairman of neurovision chair of the department of neurosurgery and director of the maxine dunitz neurosurgical institute at cedarssinai we know that alzheimers begins as many as 10 or 20 years before cognitive decline becomes evident and we believe that potential treatments may be more effective if they can be started early in the process therefore screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease steven verdooner neurovision ceo said the imaging system leverages the companys expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software its exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the alzheimers field our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use affordable and widely accessible we look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of alzheimers both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease our next step is to continue with clinical trials building upon the existing pharmaceutical company collaborations to ensure our technology is ready for the medical community to help manage this disease the studys first author yosef koronyo a research associate at cedarssinai and a scientist and inventor at neurovision said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries in 2010 our research group published an article providing the first evidence for the existence of alzheimersspecific plaques in the human retina and we demonstrated the ability to detect individual plaques in live mouse models using a modified ophthalmic device after adapting the technology for human application the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the united states and australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying betaamyloid plaques in patients with the disease in the new article the researchers report on a 16patient clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying betaamyloid in the eye using autofluorescence imaging they also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on alzheimers pathology in the retina results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients 23 with confirmed alzheimers disease and 14 controls among key findings the researchers report a 47fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with alzheimers compared to controls and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina with the imaging technologys ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal betaamyloid these findings may lead to a practical approach for largescale identification of the atrisk population and monitoring of alzheimers the researchers say the article provides new insights into the diseases manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system here are several highlights the first histologic quantitative analysis of retinal plaque clusters or hot spots containing the most toxic forms of betaamyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored a detailed analysis of betaamyloid deposit types using electron microscopy the first report of certain alzheimersrelated pathologies in the retina including vascular amyloid pathology the demonstration of a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaques and coexistence of neuronal loss the first feasibility study for noninvasively detecting presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients the demonstration of a fully automated calculation quantifying retinal autofluorescence that showed a 21fold increase in patients with alzheimers compared with controls
real,ottawa on august 21 2017 researchers at the childrens hospital of eastern ontario cheo looked at the incidence of and risk factors associated with sedationrelated adverse events in pediatric emergency departments as part of a multicentre observational study published today in jama pediatrics when children and youth present at an emergency department and require an immediate painful procedure it is standard to sedate the patient so they can tolerate the treatment procedural sedation is commonly used for painful or uncomfortable procedures like setting fractures repairing lacerations and draining abscesses in emergency departments worldwide although sedationrelated serious adverse events occur infrequently recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety said dr maala bhatt lead author director of pediatric emergency research at cheo and assistant professor at the university of ottawa weve been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes which is practicechanging according to the authors this study represents the largest and most robust prospective emergency department procedural sedation cohort to date it includes children from six emergency departments across canada sedated with six different medication combinations the results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events the incidence of serious adverse events was lowest among patients sedated with ketaminealone and highest among patients sedated with combination drugs ketamine plus propofol or fentanyl the overall incidence of adverse events in the study population was 117 the most common events were a decrease in oxygen saturation 56 and vomiting 52 significant interventions in response to an adverse event were rare occurring in only 14 of children two other practices receiving an opioid prior to sedation and having a laceration repair were associated with the occurrence of vomiting oxygen desaturation and need for significant interventions the low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians said dr bhatt while all sedation medications and combination of medications are effective and safe in the hands of experienced providers ketaminealone is associated with the fewest serious adverse events and significant interventions making it a logical choice for providing procedural sedation for children in emergency departments

real,philadelphia pa august 14 2017 stanford university scientists have described a new type of test that can detect genetic mutations in minute amounts of dna released from cancer cells into the blood the test which is called single color digital pcr requires only a fraction of a tube of blood and can detect as few as three mutationbearing molecules in a single reaction according to the report in the journal of molecular diagnostics this highly sensitive test has the potential to be personalized to recognize mutations unique to any individual cancer for monitoring patient tumors only a handful of blood tests are available which are limited to only several types of cancers nearly all cancer patients require monitoring by whole body imaging which can be costly complex and timeconsuming in contrast molecular tests like the one we have developed will enable patients to be monitored at every visit and thus have the potential for quickly tracking cancer growth and spread moreover the tests rapid turnaround and relatively low cost especially compared to nextgeneration dna sequencing provide a potential opportunity for universal monitoring of more patients than is currently done explained lead investigator hanlee p ji md associate professor in the department of medicine at stanford university and senior associate director of the stanford genome technology center the report describes the use of the test to analyze samples from six patients five patients were previously diagnosed with colorectal cancer and one with cholangiocarcinoma after generation of customized mutation detection assays the researchers were able to identify tumorderived circulating dna from three out of six patients in one patient the assay was able to show the presence of three different mutations the three patients whose samples did not show elevated cancer dna were undergoing active treatment at the time of collection the singlecolor digital pcr test offers several advantages over other methods of circulating tumor dna analysis compared to nextgeneration targeted sequencing and fluorescent probebased digital pcr assays the main advantage is that the new technique does not rely on preamplification which can introduce errors and biases this test is simple enough to set up and analyze without extensive training and therefore it can be implemented by anyone making it highly accessible to any laboratory it has been truly motivating to work with a technology that will help transform the way that we monitor and treat individuals with cancer i am excited to share our findings with the cancer research community noted lead author and researcher christina wood bouwens of the stanford genome technology center and the division of oncology department of medicine stanford university school of medicine stanford california
real,new research shows that resistance training protects the brain in persons with multiple sclerosis which may delay the development of the disease in the past multiple sclerosis patients were advised not to exercise for fear of exacerbating the illness however it is now known that physical training can relieve many of the symptoms including the excessive fatigue and mobility impairments that are often seen new research now shows that resistance training may protect the nervous system and thus slow the progression of the disease this is the main finding of a study conducted by a research partnership between aarhus university aarhus university hospital the university of southern denmark and the university medical center hamburgeppendorf that has just been published in multiple sclerosis journal the study shows that resistance training has a number of positive effects on the brain which go beyond what can be achieved through effective disease specific medication over the past six years we have been pursuing the idea that physical training has effects on more than just the symptoms and this study provides the first indications that physical exercise may protect the nervous system against the disease says one of the researchers behind the study associate professor ulrik dalgas from the department of public health at aarhus university for the past 15 years we have known that physical exercise does not harm people with multiple sclerosis but instead often has a positive impact on for example their ability to walk their levels of fatigue their muscle strength and their aerobic capacity which has otherwise often deteriorated but the fact that physical training also seems to have a protective effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis is new and important knowledge says ulrik dalgas in the study the researchers followed 35 people with multiple sclerosis for six months half of the group engaged in resistance training twice a week while the other half continued to live their lives normally without systematic training prior to and following the sixmonth period the test subjects had their brains mrscanned and the researchers could see that there was a tendency for the brain to shrink less in those patients who undertook resistance training among persons with multiple sclerosis the brain shrinks markedly faster than normal drugs can counter this development but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication in addition we saw that several smaller brain areas actually started to grow in response to training says ulrik dalgas the researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis a bigger and more indepth ongoing study will help to clarify this and may also lead to improved treatment options says ulrik dalgas however he stresses that the aim is not to replace medication with physical training phasing out drugs in favour of training is not realistic on the other hand the study indicates that systematic physical training can be a far more important supplement during treatment than has so far been assumed this aspect needs to be thoroughly explored says ulrik dalgas it is not yet clear whether all people with multiple sclerosis can benefit from this type of exercise as it has not been sufficiently tested in the more severely affected patients therefore ulrik dalgas is not recommending that all multiple sclerosis patients throw themselves into intensive physical training regimes without first seeking professional advice

real,imagine plopping six cups of coffee grounds on the heads of patients just before they are wheeled into the operating room to have nose or throat surgery in essence that is what a team of vanderbilt university engineers are proposing in an effort to improve the reliability of the sophisticated gps system that surgeons use for these delicate operations they have designed a granular jamming cap filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods they are disclosing the novel design and data on its effectiveness at the international conference on information processing in computerassisted interventions in barcelona on june 20 of course the coffee grounds are not loose they form a thin layer inside a stretchy silicone headpiece which looks something like a black latex swim cap decorated with reflective dots after the cap is placed on the patients head it is attached to a vacuum pump that sucks the air out of the cap jamming the tiny grounds together to form a rigid layer that conforms closely to the shape of the patients head this is the same effect that turns vacuumpacked coffee into solid bricks before surgery a special scanner is used to map the location of the dots relative to key features on the patients head a process called registration then during surgery an overhead camera observes the position of the dots allowing the navigation system to accurately track the position of the patients head when the surgeon repositions it the computer uses this information to combine a ct scan which provides a detailed 3d view of the bone and soft tissue hidden inside the patients head with the position of the instruments the surgeon is using and displays them together in real time on a monitor in the operating room these are very delicate operations and a sophisticated image guidance system has been developed to help the surgeons but they dont trust the system because sometimes it is spot on and other times it is off the mark said robert webster associate professor of mechanical engineering and otolaryngology who is developing a surgical robot designed specifically for endonasal surgery when we heard about this we began wondering what was causing these errors and we decided to investigate when webster and his research team looked into the matter they were surprised by what they found they discovered it wasnt the hardware or the software in the guidance system that was causing the problem it was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patients head that was at fault typically these fiducial markers are attached by an elastic headband and doublebacked tape and are subject to jarring and slipping their tests found that skin movement and accidental bumps by operating room staff both produced large tracking errors the basic assumption is that after registration the spatial relationships between the patients head and the fiducial markers remains constant said patrick wellborn the graduate student who is making the presentation unfortunately that is not the case for one thing studies have shown that the skin on a persons forehead can move as much as a half an inch relative to the skull and accidentally bumping or dragging cables over the headband can also produce significant targeting errors in fact previous research has found that when everything goes well the guidance system produces targeting errors of about 2 millimeters but in about one operation out of seven the target error is much larger forcing the surgeon to redo the registration process actually we do have a solution to this problem but it involves drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skullwhich we dont like to do because it is painful and its a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing said assistant professor of otolaryngology paul russell who is collaborating with the engineers on the project so the team began thinking up alternative noninvasive methods to attach these critical markers webster recalled some experiments that were done using coffee grounds to help robots grip irregularly shaped objects bladders filled with coffee grounds were built into the robots gripper when it grabbed an object the bladders conformed to its shape then a vacuum was pulled the coffee grounds became rigid and locked the object into place the researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem in the last three years they have gone through a number of designs they began with headbands that had coffeegroundfilled bags over the temples their tests showed that these models could reduce the targeting error by about 50 percent but the engineers still werent satisfied then wellborn who was taking over the project had a brainstorming session with fellow graduate student richard hendrick among the materials that his predecessor had left behind was a latex bald cap that sparked the idea of caps in general wellborn recalled we wanted something elastic that was form fitting which led to the idea of a swim cap in addition to fitting extremely tightly to the head the new design had another advantage the headband system has only three fiducial markers attached on the ends of three thin rods to form a triangle the new design allowed them to attach several dozen markers directly to the surface of the cap which the researchers believe will also contribute to improving the guidance systems accuracy they designed three tests to determine how well this granular jamming cap performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error they bumped both them from a number of different directions with a tennis ball filled with plastic particles swinging on the end of a string they found that the cap reduced targeting errors by 83 percent they simulated the case where a cable or other piece of equipment is accidentally pushed against the two by applying forces ranging from four to six pounds in different directions they determined that the cap outperformed the headband by 76 percent when the forces were applied to the headband and by 92 percent when they were applied to the markers they tested the effects of head repositioning by having an experienced surgeon reposition test subjects heads six to seven times in this case the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband on the strength of these results vanderbilt university has applied for a patent on the design and the technology is available for licensing interested parties should contact the vanderbilt center for technology transfer and commercialization its a very clever waythat doesnt involve drilling holes in patients skullsto greatly improve the accuracy of the guidance system when we are operating in the middle of a persons skull a zone where the accuracy of the current system is inadequate said russell
real,cognitive behavioral therapy which traditionally includes regular and often weekly visits to a clinician is recommended by the american college of physicians and other organizations for treatment of chronic insomnia for military personnel internetdelivered cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be an effective alternative to meeting regularly with a therapist although it is about half as effective as traditional methods according to results of a study conducted by daniel taylor university of north texas professor of psychology and director of unts sleep health research laboratory taylor received a 116 million grant from the us department of defense for the study which was affiliated with the strong star consortium a federally funded network of national experts seeking the best ways to treat behavioral health problems impacting post911 service members and veterans the study was published in sleep the official journal of the sleep research society chronic insomnia is defined by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders as sleeping poorly at least three nights a week for a month or longer despite adequate opportunity for a full nights sleep it is a significant problem in the military said taylor who noted that military personnel often develop insomnia because of rapidly changing schedules and deployments that keep them constantly on alert chronic insomnia is a strong risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder depression and substance abuse absenteeism and occupational accidents taylor said treatment of insomnia may not only improve sleep in these soldiers but also improve these other conditions he said about 10 percent of deployed military personnel take sleep medications which are effective for shortterm treatment of insomnia in civilian populations for deployed military personnel the side effects such as grogginess slowed cognitive processing and slowed reaction time can be dangerous taylor said one hundred soldiers at fort hood who had chronic insomnia were recruited for taylors study all completed one week of sleep monitoring by keeping sleep diaries and wearing activity monitors one third of the participants met with clinicians at fort hood for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia once a week for six weeks while another third received the therapy via the internet once a week for six weeks both the inperson and internet therapy had the exact same content with the internet lessons presented as audio recordings accompanied by visual graphics and animations a third control group of participants was contacted by the researchers every other week during the six weeks but did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy taylor discovered that the study participants who received inperson cognitive behavioral treatment for their insomnia reported significantly greater improvements in sleep quality as determined by the sleep diaries and activity monitors than those who received the internet therapy both groups had greater improvements in sleep quality than those who did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy he noted that that cognitive behavioral therapy is a multifaceted intervention that can be difficult to administer without the benefit of a therapist additional training in the therapy for behavioral health providers in all branches of the military is needed he said in a previous study of civilians with insomnia taylor and his research team discovered that cognitive behavioral therapy led to significant improvements in sleep efficiency with the research subjects use of sleep medication declining from 875 percent before therapy to 54 percent afterward although the subjects werent required to stop taking their medication kristi pruiksma a strong star collaborating investigator and clinical psychologist served as a clinician on taylors study she said the benefits of the online therapy include easy access to the treatment and flexibility in times for completing the sessions which is really helpful for those juggling work and family demands the online program can also be done from home rather than at a military behavioral health clinic which some service members may avoid due to concerns about stigma said pruiksma an assistant professor of psychiatry at the university of texas health science center at san antonio ut health san antonio successful treatment has a real impact on patients daily lives an important next step will be to figure out who is able to achieve good benefits from the online program and who is likely to need additional assistance from a therapist she said

real,a team of researchers from cleveland clinic louis stokes cleveland va medical center kaiser permanente northwest and other clinical sites have demonstrated that a new blood test known as isopsa detects prostate cancer more precisely than current tests in two crucial measures distinguishing cancer from benign conditions and identifying patients with highrisk disease by identifying molecular changes in the prostate specific antigen psa protein the findings published online last month by european urology suggest that once validated use of isopsa may substantially reduce the need for biopsy and may thus lower the likelihood of overdetection and overtreatment of nonlethal prostate cancer the research team led by cleveland clinics eric klein md conducted a multicenter prospective study of 261 men scheduled for prostate biopsy at five academic and community centers in the us enrolled between august 2015 and december 2016 despite criticism psa has transformed the landscape of early detection screening and management of prostate cancer in the last few decades said dr klein chair of cleveland clinics glickman urological kidney institute unfortunately psa is tissuespecific but not cancerspecific leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biologically insignificant cancers which is widely recognized as a key limitation in its clinical utility the study directly compared the clinical performance of a new test based on psa called isopsa to psa itself with patients already scheduled for prostate biopsy isopsa proved significantly superior to psa in two key indications discriminating between prostate cancer and benign conditions and identifying patients with highgrade disease the former indication is potentially useful for using isopsa for screening by primary care physicians while the second is helpful for urologists in identifying patients who would benefit from curative intent therapy and other applications the results show that if validated and adopted clinically isopsa could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsies by almost 50 percent the methodology used in the isopsa assay represents a significant departure from conventional ways to define biomarkers in blood and may be applicable to improving other cancer biomarkers said dr klein due to its inherent simplicity requiring only a blood draw and presenting information to the physician in familiar context using a single number just like psa itself we are quite hopeful in isopsas future utility after further validation studies said mark stovsky md coauthor and staff member cleveland clinic glickman urological kidney institute

real,there is no significant difference between zinc acetate lozenges and zinc gluconate lozenges regarding their efficacy in shortening the duration of common colds according to a metaanalysis published in journal of the royal society of medicine open seven randomized trials with zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges found that the duration of colds was shortened on average by 33 zinc lozenges appear to influence the common cold through the release of free zinc ions into the oropharyngeal region however zinc ions can bind tightly to various chemical complexes in such a way that little or no free zinc ions are released previously zinc lozenges containing citric acid were shown to be ineffective in treating colds because citric acid binds zinc ions very tightly and no free zinc is released zinc acetate has been proposed as the most ideal salt for zinc lozenges since acetate binds to zinc ions very weakly zinc gluconate is another salt that has been frequently used in zinc lozenges however gluconate binds the zinc ion more tightly than acetate does because of the somewhat stronger binding zinc gluconate has been proposed to be less suitable constituent for lozenges although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold in the metaanalysis dr harri hemil from the university of helsinki finland collected randomized trials on zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges and compared their observed efficacies three trials had used zinc acetate lozenges and found that colds were shortened on average by 40 four trials had used zinc gluconate lozenges and colds were shortened on average by 28 the 12 difference between the average effects of the two kinds of lozenges was explained purely by random variation furthermore one of the zinc gluconate lozenge trials was an outlier inconsistent with all the other six zinc lozenge trials if that outlier trial was excluded the difference between the three zinc acetate and the three zinc gluconate trials shrinked to just 2 ie a 40 vs 38 reduction in common cold duration thus properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges dr hemil also analyzed the dose response relationship between the elemental zinc dose and the observed efficacy in reducing common cold duration there was no difference in the efficacy between five trials that used 80 to 92 mg of zinc per day and the two trials that used 192 and 207 mg of zinc per day thus zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit according to dr hemil there is no justification for the popular phrase that there is no cure for the common cold because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30 however in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated the optimum frequency of their administration also warrants further investigation nevertheless he also considers that the current evidence of efficacy for zinc lozenges is so strong that common cold patients should be encouraged to try them for treating their colds but the patients should ascertain that the lozenges do not contain citric acid or its salt citrate

real,duarte calif a city of hopeled study found that the use of lowdose aspirin 81mg reduces the risk of breast cancer in women who are part of the californias teachers study this study which is the first to suggest that the reduction in risk occurs for lowdose aspirin was proposed by city of hopes leslie bernstein phd professor and director of the division of biomarkers of early detection and prevention and published online in the journal breast cancer research bernstein and her colleagues saw an overall 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer in women who reported using lowdose aspirin at least three times per week such regular use of lowdose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive her2 negative breast cancer which is the most common breast cancer subtype the study found an interesting protective association between lowdose aspirin and breast cancer said lead author christina a clarke phd mph from the cancer prevention institute of california we did not by and large find associations with the other pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen we also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease this study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of lowdose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin it was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer we already knew that aspirin is a weak aromatase inhibitor and we treat women with breast cancer with stronger aromatase inhibitors since they reduce the amount of estrogen postmenopausal women have circulating in their blood said bernstein we thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors bernstein added aspirin also reduces inflammation which may be another mechanism by which aspirin taken regularly can lower risk of breast cancer developing or recurring as part of the study researchers analyzed data recorded in questionnaires submitted by 57164 women in the californias teachers study in 2005 participants answered questions regarding family history of cancer and other conditions use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids menstrual and reproductive history use of hormones weight and height living environment diet alcohol use and physical activity in the ensuing years before 2013 1457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer the team of researchers chose to focus on lowdose baby aspirin because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer now that we have some data separating lowdose from higherdose aspirin more detailed research can be undertaken to understand the full value of lowdose aspirin for breast cancer prevention said clarke
real,worcester mass when the standard malaria medications failed to help 18 critically ill patients the attending physician in a congo clinic acted under the compassionate use doctrine and prescribed a notyetapproved malaria therapy made only from the dried leaves of the artemisia annua plant in just five days all 18 people fully recovered this small but stunningly successful trial offers hope to address the growing problem of drugresistant malaria details of the cases are documented in the paper artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to act and iv artesunate case reports by an international team lead by pamela weathers phd professor of biology and biotechnology at worcester polytechnic institute wpi who has pioneered the use of dried leaves of artemisia annua dla as a malaria therapy to our knowledge this is the first report of driedleaf artemisia annua controlling actresistant malaria in humans the authors of the phytomedicine paper note adding that more comprehensive clinical trials on patients with drugresistant malaria are warranted successful treatment of all 18 actresistant cases suggests that dla should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for africa they added and possibly wherever else act resistance has emerged watch a video about research at wpi related to this study the report documents the experiences of 18 patients in the north kivu province of the democratic republic of congo who showed symptoms of malaria and were originally treated with the recommended medication artemisininbased combination therapy act which blends artemisinin a chemical extract from artemisia annua with one or more other drugs that attack the malaria parasite in different ways the 18 patients ranging in age from 14 months to 60 years did not respond to the standard act treatment and all lapsed into severe malaria defined by symptoms that can include loss of consciousness respiratory distress convulsions and pulmonary edema one patient a fiveyearold child became comatose all were then treated with intravenously administered artesunate the frontline medication for severe malaria but again they showed no improvement as a last resort doctors turned to driedleaf artemisia dla a therapy developed and extensively studied by weathers and her team at wpi after five days of treatment with tablets made from only the dried and powered leaves of artemisia which has been prepared and analyzed using methods developed by weathers and postdoctoral fellow melissa towler all 18 patients fully recovered laboratory tests showed they had no parasites remaining in their blood weathers noted more than 100 other drugresistant patients also have been successfully treated with dla tablets these 18 patients were dying weathers said so to see 100 percent recover even the child who had lapsed into a coma was just amazing its a small study but the results are powerful according to the world health organization who more than 212 million people contracted malaria in 2015 and some 429000 died with young children and pregnant women being particularly vulnerable caused by a mosquitoborne parasite the illness is reported in nearly 100 countries and threatens nearly half of the worlds population act the current recommended therapy is expensive to produce and is in short supply in areas hit hardest by the disease in addition while the combination therapy is designed to be less prone to the drug resistance that has rendered previous antimalarial agents ineffective increasingly the malaria parasite is showing signs of resistance to act particularly in southeast asia weathers began her research on artemisinin and artemesia annua also known as sweet wormwood more than 25 years ago in recent years she has turned her attention to the use of dla as an alternative to conventional antimalarial drugs noting that artemisia annua which is classified as a generally regarded as safe gras herb has been consumed by humans and used as an herbal therapy for thousands of years often in the form of a tea she became intrigued by the potential for using the dried plant rather than just a chemical extract as a malaria treatment a study she published in photochemistry reviews in 2011 was the first to demonstrate that dried leaves of the artemisia annua plant delivers 40 times more artemisinin to the blood than does the drug based on the chemical extract of the plant in a paper published in plos one the following year weathers and her team showed that not only does dla have antimalarial properties it is more effective in knocking out the parasite and reduced the level of parasite infection more completely in mice in a 2015 study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the wpi researchers with colleagues at the university of massachusetts amherst showed that dried artemisia leaves cured rodents infected with malaria strains that were known to be resistant to artemisinin and in an experiment that accelerated the evolution of the malaria parasite by passing it through up to 49 generations of mice the parasite showed no signs of resistance to dla weathers says the superior performance of dla in comparison to act as well as its ability to kill drugresistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap itself is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plants leaves several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria in effect the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy one whose benefits far surpass those of act and other combination drugs we have done a lot of work to understand the biochemistry of these compounds which include a number of flavonoids and terpenes so we can better understand the role they play in the pharmacological activity of the dried leaves weathers said the more we learn the more excited we become about the potential for dla to be the medication of choice for combatting malaria worldwide artemisia annua is known to be efficacious against a range of other diseases including other tropical maladies and certain cancers so in our lab we are already at work investigating the effectiveness of dla with other diseases another advantage of dla over conventional malaria treatments is its low cost and the relative simplicity of its manufacture weathers said while the processes for manufacturing act is costlier and requires a higher degree of expertise producing dla tablets can be accomplished with simpler equipment and a modest amount of training growing artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets weathers noted are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy in fact she has already established a supply chain in africa that includes growing and harvesting highproducing cultivars in east africa along with gmp good manufacturing practice processing operations in uganda where the leaves are dried pulverized and homogenized where the powder is compacted into tablets and where the tablets are tested to verify their dosage this supply chain helped produce the tablets used to treat the 18 patients in the democratic republic of congo this simple technology can be owned operated and distributed by africans for africans weathers said
real,for immediate release newswise the latest in a series of studies led by researchers at johns hopkins medicine shows that addition of a widely available noninvasive imaging test called 99mtcsestamibi spectct to ct or mri increases the accuracy of kidney tumor classification the research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the united states alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery in a recent report on ongoing work to improve kidney tumor classification published in the april issue of the journal clinical nuclear medicine the team reports that the sestamibi spectct testshort for 99mtcsestamibi singlephoton emission computed tomographycomputed tomographyct adds additional diagnostic information in conjunction with conventional cts and mri and improves physicians ability to differentiate between benign and malignant kidney tumors sestamibi spectct lets radiologists and urologists see the most common benign kidney tumor something ct and mri have not succeeded in doing alone says mohamad e allaf md mea endowed professor of urology at the johns hopkins university school of medicine this noninvasive scan may prevent patients with a potentially benign kidney tumor from having to undergo a surgery to remove the tumor or potentially the entire kidney along with its associated risks and high costs at johns hopkins use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis these results are hugely encouraging but we need to do more studies for this study 48 patients who were diagnosed with a kidney tumor on conventional ct or mri were imaged with sestamibi spectct at johns hopkins prior to surgery radiologists who were not allowed to talk to each other or know the results of the surgeries graded the conventional and sestamibi spectct images benign or malignant using a 5point scale 1 definitely benign 5 definitely cancerous following surgery similarly blinded pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists imaging results pathology results of surgically removed tumors showed that 8 of the 48 were benign the remaining 40 were classified as a variety of other tumor types including malignant renal cell carcinomas reviewing sestamibi spectct scan results in conjunction with ct or mri changed the initial rating levels from cancerous score 3 4 5 toward benign score 1 and 2 in 9 cases and changed reviewers score from likely cancerous score 4 to definitely cancerous score 5 in 5 cases or about 10 percent of all cases the addition of sestamibi spectct increased the reviewers diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients or in nearly 30 percent of all cases overall the investigators said adding sestamibi spectct helped identify 7 of 9 benign tumors and conventional imaging with added sestamibi spectct outperformed conventional imaging alone as measured by a statistical analysis that measures tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity on this measure a value of 050 indicates that a diagnostic test is no better than chance conventional imaging combined with sestamibi spectct had a value of 085 while conventional imaging alone had a value of 060 even for patients whose tumors were not reclassified the addition of sestamibi spectct increased physicians ability to more confidently classify malignant tumors which reduces the risk of misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery for all patients the researchers say radiologists and urologists have been frustrated for decades by the inability of conventional imaging tests such as ct and mri to distinguish benign from malignant kidney tumors at johns hopkins multispecialty teams work together to determine the best care for patients and as partners on research innovations and quality improvement initiatives this collaborative venue enabled two thenresidents drs michael gorin and steven rowe from different departments and specialties to design a clinical trial based on a few reports in the literature suggesting a potential role for sestamibi spectct in this diagnostic conundrum and their hypothesis proved correct says mehrbod som javadi md assistant professor of radiology at johns hopkins university school of medicine and the senior author on the paper pamela t johnson md associate professor of radiology at the johns hopkins university school of medicine notes these types of advances are critical to our precision medicine initiative hopkins inhealth designed for individualized patient management and to our mission of highvalue health care where the highest quality care is safely delivered at the lowest personal and financial cost to the patient as radiologists we have struggled to find noninvasive ways to better classify patients and spare unnecessary surgery but this has not been easy says steven p rowe md phd one of the two former residents who developed this approach and now assistant professor of radiology and radiological science at the johns hopkins university school of medicine sestamibi spectct offers an inexpensive and widely available means of better characterizing kidney tumors and the identical test is now being performed as part of a large trial in sweden for which the first results have just recently been published and appear to confirm our conclusions although further study is needed to validate the accuracy of sestamibi spectct this test appears to be a less expensive faster noninvasive alternative to surgery says michael a gorin md the other resident involved in developing this approach and now chief resident with the james buchanan brady urological institute of the johns hopkins university school of medicine in the absence of diagnostic certainty surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution leading to an estimated 5600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the united states other authors on this paper include sara sheikhbahaei christopher s jones kristin k porter alex s baras phillip m pierorazio mark w ball lilja b

to the hospital with advanced stages of disease who were referred early to palliative care had decreased health care utilization and increased use of support services following discharge according to a new study led by researchers at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai published today in the journal of oncology practice the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in 30day readmission rates hospice referral and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers this is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures patients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status quality of life and functional ability the integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use yet many patients are never offered these services as cancer progresses patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress said cardinale b smith md mscr associate professor of medicine hematology and medical oncology and of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai health care utilization is extremely high once cancer progresses with hospital readmission rates as high as 40 percent and death in the acute care setting ranging from 3050 percent both measures of poorquality

unit at the mount sinai hospital patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria advanced solid tumor cancer prior hospitalization within 30 days hospitalization for more than 7 days or active symptoms care for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acutecare hospital wards and intensive care units or receiving invasive procedures chemotherapy infusions and radiographic imaging such interventions drive escalating costs and are often directly in conflict with patients prior stated wishes said dr smith

real,philadelphia labor is an intensely strenuous activity with the uterine muscle contracting every few minutes to reposition a baby through the pelvis and down the birth canal even low levels of dehydration can seriously compromise normal physiological function yet recent studies looking at hydration in laboring women via the rates of intravenous iv fluid showed conflicting results by pooling the data of several studies thomas jefferson university researchers showed that a higher rate of iv fluids not only decreased csection rates but also shortened the overall length of labor by one hour as well as shortened the pushing phase the results were published online as an accepted article in acta obstetricia et gynecologica scandinavica the results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice says vincenzo berghella md the director of maternal fetal medicine and professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the sidney kimmel medical college at thomas jefferson university we have already begun changing practice at jefferson to give women more fluids in labor to allow them to have the best chance of delivering vaginally dr berghella and colleagues compiled data from seven small clinical trials that collectively included a total of 1215 women of those about half or 593 women received iv fluids at a rate of 250 milliliters per hour and the other half 622 women received fluids at the lower rate of 125 milliliters per hour general practice in the united states is to administer iv fluids at 125 milliliters per hour during labor with the data pooled the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups women getting the faster fluid rate 250 milliliters per hour were less likely to get a cesarean section the higher fluid rate also reduced the overall time of labor by an average of 64 minutes and shortened the pushing phase by nearly 3 minutes on average weve known that its important for women to stay well hydrated during pregnancy and labor this study suggests that iv fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels reduce the likelihood of csection and decrease length of labor says dr berghella recently we also showed that letting women eat more liberally in labor especially in early labor has benefits including shorter labor and no identifiable risks today approximately one in three births in the united states occurs via csection despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice this study and others are providing evidence for changes in obstetric practice that could help safely reduce csection rates drs ehsanipoor saccone seligman piercewilliams and ciardulli were the coinvestigators with dr berghella
real,augusta ga march 9 2017 the first year of free lung cancer screening in the augusta georgia area found more than double the rate seen in a previous large national study as well as a massachusettsbased screening for this number one cancer killer the higher rates coupled with the majority of cases being found in early treatable stages point toward the need for ongoing accessible free screening in highrisk populations and underserved regions say researchers at the georgia cancer center at augusta university high risk includes those who have smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for two or three decades and if theyve quit smoking did so less than 15 years ago the screening of 264 highrisk individuals within a 150mile radius of augusta found 3 percent had lung cancer and 75 percent of those were caught early said dr carsten schroeder thoracic oncology surgeon at the georgia cancer center and medical college of georgia at au the researchers note that a percentage of the patients presenting at screening had early symptoms like a persistent cough so the rate of cancer detection in patients who showed no indication of disease was 22 percent still double the rates of previous studies lung cancer is still the number one cancer killer in the united states and in our world schroeder said if we catch it in the early stages ideally before symptoms surface we can operate and patients can have an overall survival rate of 90 percent fiveyear survival rates are closer to 5 percent in more advanced disease the pioneering national lung screening trial which began in 2002 and included 33 largely urban centers found 292 cases of lung cancer among the 26722 highrisk individuals screened in the first year for a rate of 11 percent that study also provided the first broad evidence that lowdose computed tomography or ldct was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest xray a decade later the massachusettsbased lahey hospital medical center on which the augusta screening was modeled found a 6 percent prevalence in the first 10 months of screening like the previous experiences the augusta area screening that started in 2014 also reiterated the ability of ldct to find lung cancer early said schroeder corresponding author of the study in southern medical journal six of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery positive results were communicated directly to the participants primary care provider negative results were communicated to primary care docs and participants along with a reminder for another screening in a year participants particularly from surrounding more rural communities have limited access to health care schroeder said the areas median household income is 27 percent lower than the national average and the poverty level is 67 percent higher according to the us census bureau the augustaarea experience found generally younger patients who started smoking earlier in life and had multiple risk factors augusta area participants were an average of 60 years old about half male and female more than 68 percent were white and nearly 20 percent were black it doesnt matter how old you are if you have smoked 30 years you might want to consider a lungcancer screening schroeder said referencing the reality that some adults started smoking as children part of his drive to start a screening program in the augusta area was that when he relocated here three years ago from the cleveland area he found patients were often referred to him with later lesstreatable disease in the cleveland area where schroeder previously practiced as a faculty member at case western reserve university and where access to health care andor health insurance was more widely available early lung cancers might even be detected incidentally when patients had ct scans for a variety of other reasons augusta researchers were able to offer free screening by utilizing natural downtime of the combined positive emission tomography or pet and computed tomography or ct scanner said dr norman b thomson iii chief of generalcardiothoracic radiology in the mcg department of radiology and imaging and study coauthor the combination technology is often used to visualize other tumor types throughout the body and many patients require an injection of sugar dye which will be taken up by the tumor but must first circulate for about an hour before the scan is done that means the machine is staffed at times when it is not able to be fully used for other diagnostic procedures time that provides a natural window for lung screening using just the ct imaging capability in under five minutes from arrival to exit thomson said more typically a scan could cost between 100250 in the last decade ct technology has gotten increasingly adept at picking up early small nodules thomson said low radiation doses work well in the lungs which are mostly filled with air that provides a blank background for nodule surveillance thomson notes that means ldct is also adept at finding things like scar tissue and small inflammatory nodules that also are more common in the lungs of smokers nodules a third of an inch or smaller tend not to be cancer and more solid masses tend to be thomson said they may follow up on smaller nodules in six months then if the nodule is stable go back to annual reviews and while some lung cancers are super aggressive screening also may uncover some slowgrowing versions that like some prostate cancers will not threaten life but need to be treated andor closely followed once found thats why the acid test for screening is not how many cancers you find or what stage the cancer is thomson said rather what screening does to lung cancer death rates current evidence definitely supports screening he said also like lung cancer has been coincidently found in ct scans for other reasons physicians like thomson and schroeder are now incidentally finding cardiovascular disease in their lung cancer screening to date about 700 individuals have been screened in the augusta area and schroeder is working to expand statewide hoping to use the state public medical schools extensive campus network that has students learning from physicians at practices and hospitals across georgia as a natural base we want to reach as many people as we can as early as we can he said also about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention schroeder said the original national lung screening trial orchestrated by the national cancer institute and the american college of radiology was launched in 2002 and enrolled nearly 54000 patients nationally fiveyear survival rates were about 70 percent for early cancers and about 5 percent for lung cancer found late following the trial the national comprehensive cancer network a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment along with the united states preventive services task force which makes recommendations for preventive medicine recommended screening highrisk individuals on a slightly broader scale which the lahey and augusta area screening used the group recommends screening for those age 5580 with a 30pack year or greater history who have stopped smoking for 15 years or less and those age 50 or older with a 20pack year smoking history and an additional risk factor other than secondhand smoke such as family history of lung cancer or a personal cancer history a pack year means smoking one pack a day for 30 years or a variation like two packs daily for 15 years after 15 years of not smoking the lung cancer risk tends to diminish but never vanishes schroeder would prefer the screening still not stop there a total of 398 individuals signed up for the augusta area screening 350 qualified and 264 actually had ldct more than 80 patients were not screened in the first year primarily because of socioeconomic and travel limitations that created a sixweek backlog ninety percent of lung cancer is related to cigarette smoking the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the united states according to the centers for disease control and prevention symptoms of lung cancer include persistent intense coughing shortness of breath pain in the chest shoulder or back and changes in the color andor volume of phlegm or mucus hoarseness and coughing up blood a 2015 survey of smoking by adults by the centers for disease control and prevention found about 15 percent of adults in the country smoked rates for georgia and adjacent south carolina were between 1620 percent rates in massachusetts where the lahey screening occurred are 128 to 164 percent rates were highest in certain

real,rochester minn a new type of blood test may help physicians identify which patients with and without evidence of coronary blockages are at risk for heart attacks and strokes even individuals with normal levels of lowdensity lipoprotein ldl known as the socalled bad cholesterol but still at risk seem to be identified according to mayo clinic research being presented at the american college of cardiologys 66th annual scientific session the test released commercially by mayo medical laboratories in august 2016 measures blood concentrations of plasma ceramides a class of lipids that are highly linked to cardiovascular disease processes the study found that individuals with the highest levels of blood ceramides were found to have a 3 to 4times greater risk of having a cardiovascular event compared with those with the lowest ceramide score regardless of their ldl cholesterol level or the presence of a blockage in the hearts arteries our research suggests that evaluating ceramide levels in patients who are not at immediate risk for coronary artery disease events may help cardiologists decide who could benefit from proactive and preventive treatment such as statins or lifestyle changes to prevent a serious cardiac event down the road says jeff meeusen phd a clinical chemist codirector of cardiovascular laboratory medicine at mayo clinic and the studys lead author according to dr meeusen ceramides are different than cholesterol which gathers and causes a clog in the arteries ceramides are more active attracting inflammatory cells and promoting clotting in the study 499 mayo clinic patients who were referred for coronary angiography to check for possible artery blockages were included and followed prospectively for approximately eighteen years patients were similar in age and with regard to blood pressure smoking status and highdensity lipoprotein hdl the good cholesterol excluded were those who had diabetes or a previous heart attack stroke or procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12point scale patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels low 02 intermediate 36 moderate 79 and high 1012 over the eighteen years researchers recorded occurrences of heart attack stroke revascularization and death overall 51 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year but the risk of having an event became higher as ceramide level increased for each 1point increase in the ceramide risk score the risk rose by 9 percent the rate of events was double among people with the highest ceramide score compared with those with the lowest 81 vs 41 percent respectively in patients without coronary artery disease following angiography the rate of cardiovascular events was only 31 percent lower than the average overall but when researchers examined cardiovascular disease in this population by ceramide scores people with the highest levels of ceramides were four times more likely to have an event compared with those with the lowest 78 vs 22 percent respectively a similar trend was seen among people with low ldl levels <100 mgdl typically considered a good ldl target in this group the rate of heart attack stroke and revascularization and death was 37 percent among those with a low ceramide score but 164 percent in people with the highest ceramide levels there is a need to identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events so that we can test strategies to prevent those events this test seems to provide such information says allan s jaffe md senior author of the study cardiologist at mayo clinic and chair of the division of clinical core laboratory services the trial was funded by mayo clinic the new test is available to health care providers worldwide through mayo medical laboratories which offers laboratory testing and pathology services to more than 4000 health care organizations in more than 70 countries mayo medical laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and zora biosciences oy a diagnostics discovery company based in finland to develop and refine the test the present study is also the first to test its clinical utility in a us population coauthors are leslie donato phd sandra bryant grant spears peter berger md and linnea baudhuin phd all of mayo clinic
real,men who filled prescriptions for erectile dysfunction drugs in the years following a heart attack had a substantially lower risk of dying or being hospitalized for heart failure than men who did not use these drugs according to a study scheduled for presentation at the american college of cardiologys 66th annual scientific session the study which retrospectively tracked more than 43000 men for an average of 33 years found that men prescribed phosphodiesterase5 pde5 inhibitorsthe type of erectile dysfunction drug sold under the names viagra levitra cialis and othersafter their first heart attack were 33 percent less likely to die from any cause no survival benefit was seen among men taking alprostadil another type of erectile dysfunction drug that works through a different mechanism if you have an active sex life after a heart attack it is probably safe to use pde5 inhibitors said daniel peter andersson md phd a postdoctoral researcher at karolinska institutet in stockholm and the studys lead author this type of erectile dysfunction treatment is beneficial in terms of prognosis and having an active sex life seems to be a marker for a decreased risk of death the research is based on a swedish national database of health records that includes all hospitals in sweden researchers analyzed the records of men age 80 years or younger who were hospitalized for a first heart attack between 2007 and 2013 tracking the men for an average of 33 years following this first heart attack they compared outcomes among those who subsequently filled a prescription for a pde5 inhibitor or alprostadil to those who did not overall just over 7 percent of men were prescribed an erectile dysfunction drug 92 percent of whom were prescribed a pde5 inhibitor and 8 percent of whom were prescribed alprostadil after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes heart failure and stroke those taking pde5 inhibitors were found to be markedly less likely to die than those taking alprostadil or no erectile dysfunction drugs filling more prescriptions for pde5 inhibitors appeared to be associated with a greater benefit although andersson said that trend should be interpreted with caution because the study was not large enough for a definitive doseresponse analysis in addition to a decreased mortality men using pde5 inhibitors or alprostadil were 40 percent less likely to be hospitalized for heart failure compared to those not taking any erectile dysfunction drugs although the results provide evidence that pde5 inhibitors may benefit heart health the retrospective study design makes it impossible to ascertain direct cause and effect andersson noted it is possible that using erectile dysfunction drugs simply indicates a more active sex life which could itself contribute to or be a marker of a hearthealthy lifestyle overall we think that if you have an active sex life its probably an indicator of a healthy lifestyle especially in the oldest quartilethose 70 to 80 years old andersson said from the perspective of a doctor if a patient asks about erectile dysfunction drugs after a heart attack and has no contraindications for pde5 inhibitors based on these results you can feel safe about prescribing it andersson said the results came as a surprise because erectile dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of heart disease in otherwise healthy men however previous studies have associated the use of pde5 inhibitors with a decreased blood pressure in the left ventricle which reduces the amount of work required to pump blood and therefore could help explain why the drugs might benefit people with heart failure pde5 inhibitors were initially developed to treat angina a type of chest pain that results from constricted arteries the researchers also tracked the risk of a subsequent heart attack or cardiac revascularization procedure such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass but found the use of erectile dysfunction drugs had no effect on these outcomes a limitation of the study is that the researchers did not assess the effects of untreated erectile dysfunction or conversely the effect of having an active sex life without taking erectile dysfunction drugs the researchers also were unable to account for socioeconomic status as a next step they are planning a larger study that will include more health records and complete information on marital status educational level and disposable income they are also pursuing a separate analysis of outcomes from erectile dysfunction drugs in men with type 1 and type 2 diabetes
real,for immediate release march 03 2017 espaol the us food and drug administration today approved noctiva desmopressin acetate nasal spray for adults who awaken at least two times per night to urinate due to a condition known as nocturnal polyuria overproduction of urine during the night noctiva is the first fdaapproved treatment for this condition todays approval provides adults who overproduce urine at night with the first fdaapproved therapeutic option to help reduce the number of times a night they wake up to urinate said hylton v joffe md mmsc director of the division of bone reproductive and urologic products in the fdas center for drug evaluation and research it is important to know that noctiva is not approved for all causes of nighttime urination so patients should discuss their symptoms with their health care provider who can determine the underlying cause of the nighttime urination and whether noctiva is right for them nocturia wakening at night to urinate is a symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of conditions such as congestive heart failure poorly controlled diabetes mellitus medications or diseases of the bladder or prostate before considering noctiva health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the nighttime urination because noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24hour urine collection if one has not been obtained previously health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia but that make treatment with noctiva unsafe such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure noctiva is taken daily approximately 30 minutes before going to bed it works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys which leads to less urine production noctivas efficacy was established in two 12week randomized placebocontrolled trials in 1045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of nighttime urinations with noctiva compared to placebo more patients treated with noctiva were able to at least halve their number of nighttime urinations and patients treated with noctiva had more nights with one or fewer nighttime urinations noctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a medication guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood hyponatremia severe hyponatremia can be lifethreatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated leading to seizures coma respiratory arrest or death health care providers should make sure the patients sodium level is normal before starting noctiva and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter the lower noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia such as the elderly noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia such as those with excessive fluid intake those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances certain patients with kidney damage and in those using certain medicines known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids noctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions use of noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved noctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with noctiva noctiva should not be used in children the most common side effects of noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort cold symptoms nasopharyngitis nasal congestion sneezing high or increased blood pressure back pain nose bleeds bronchitis and dizziness although there are other fdaapproved medications that also contain desmopressin none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia noctiva is manufactured by renaissance lakewood llc for milford pennsylvaniabased serenity pharmaceuticals llc the fda an agency within the us department of health and human services protects the public health by assuring the safety effectiveness and security of human and veterinary drugs vaccines and other biological products for human use and medical devices the agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nations food supply cosmetics dietary supplements products that give off electronic radiation and for regulating tobacco products
real,new research indicates that dietary soy products are safe and even beneficial for women diagnosed with breast cancer published early online in cancer a peerreviewed journal of the american cancer society the findings may help resolve controversies over soys potential link to breast cancer outcomes soy foods are considered among the healthiest for human consumption but their estrogenlike properties have raised concerns of a potential increased risk of breast cancer this is because in hormone receptorpositive cancer the most common form of the disease there are some concerns that high estrogen levels help cancer cells grow and spread though this remains controversial isoflavonesthe component of soy that has estrogenlike propertieshave been shown to slow the growth of breast cancer cells in laboratory studies and epidemiological analyses in east asian women with breast cancer found links between higher isoflavone intake and reduced mortality however other research has suggested that the estrogenlike effects of isoflavones may reduce the effectiveness of hormone therapies used to treat breast cancer explained fang fang zhang md phd of the friedman school of nutrition science and policy at tufts university because of this disparity it remains unknown whether isoflavone consumption should be encouraged or avoided for breast cancer patients to provide some clarity dr zhang and her colleagues looked at the relationship between dietary intake of isoflavones and death from any cause in 6235 american and canadian women diagnosed with breast cancer over a median followup of nine years women with breast cancer who consumed high amounts of isoflavones had a 21 percent lower risk of dying than women who consumed low amounts this decrease was largely confined to women with hormone receptornegative tumors and women who were not treated with antiestrogen therapy such as tamoxifen which blocks the effects of estrogen in contrast to some previous research high levels of isoflavone intake were not associated with greater mortality among women receiving hormonal therapy based on our results we do not see a detrimental effect of soy food intake among women who were treated with endocrine therapy said dr zhang for women with hormone receptornegative breast cancer soy food products may potentially have a protective effect women who did not receive endocrine therapy as a treatment for their breast cancer had a weaker but still statistically significant association more than 20 percent of all new breast cancer cases with known estrogen and progesterone receptor status are receptornegative and they have poorer survival rates than hormone receptorpositive cases whether lifestyle factors can improve survival after diagnosis is an important question for women diagnosed with this more aggressive type of breast cancer our findings suggest that survival may be better in patients with a higher consumption of isoflavones said senior author esther john phd of the cancer prevention institute of california the investigators noted that they examined only naturally occurring dietary isoflavones not isoflavones from supplements how isoflavones from foods interact with breast cancer cells is unclear but research has shown that they have antioxidant antiinflammatory antiangiogenic and other effects that could influence tumor survival and growth in an accompanying editorial omer kucuk md of the winship cancer institute of emory university noted that the united states is the number 1 soy producer in the world and is in a great position to initiate changes in health policy encouraging soy intake we now have evidence that soy foods not only prevent breast cancer but also benefit women who have breast cancer therefore we can recommend women to consume soy foods because of soys many health benefits he wrote
real,madison wis march 1 2017 prnewswire a study from exact sciences corp nasdaq exas and mayo clinic released today by the american association of cancer research aacr shows promise for the development of a bloodbased lung cancer test researchers conducted a multiround study of nearly 400 patients which demonstrated high accuracy for detecting lung cancer at all stages these results reveal an opportunity to detect lung cancer from a simple blood draw said kevin conroy chairman and ceo of exact sciences our collaboration with mayo clinic is efficiently identifying biomarkers for additional cancer applications on the same technology platform as cologuard aacr released an abstract of the study today ahead of the presentation of the results on april 2 2017 during the aacr 2017 annual meeting the findings from the study of 398 patients 311 controls and 87 cancers demonstrate that biomarkers in plasma achieved high accuracy for all types and stages of lung cancer using two independent regression modeling approaches a panel of four novel methylated dna markers demonstrated a sensitivity of 9196 percent at a specificity of 9094 percent more studies are needed to corroborate accuracy however this plasma dna test approach appears to be a promising new method and may serve as a rational followup to the common findings of lung nodules on ct scanning and may have application in screening for lung cancer said david e midthun md a pulmonologist at mayo clinic lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality resulting in 17 million deaths globally and more than 150000 deaths in the united states every year most symptoms present in the late stages of the disease when the survival rate is only four percent early detection of lung cancer offers the opportunity to reduce mortality lung cancer screening is approved for smokers using chest ct scanning this approach has a sensitivity for lung cancer above 90 percent but its specificity may fall below 75 percent a false positive rate of more than 25 percent because indeterminate lung nodules are so common evaluation of these falsepositives leads to unnecessary costly and potentially harmful procedures a bloodbased test may help guide next steps after a scan reveals an indeterminate nodule mr conroy said for example a positive blood test might suggest the need for a biopsy or surgery in contrast a negative test might suggest a less aggressive approach such a test could offer the opportunity to significantly improve health outcomes and reduce the financial impact on the health care

real,newswise hospitals can improve patient care and reduce costs associated with coronary angioplasty if cardiologists perform more of these procedures through an artery in the wrist and if they take steps to discharge such patients on the same day according to a new study led by washington university school of medicine in st louis coronary angioplasty is a procedure in which arteries are opened to increase blood flow to the heart the research published feb 20 in jacc cardiovascular interventions suggests that the lower costs of the wrist approach largely are due to the fact that patients experience fewer complications and can be discharged earlier compared with procedures that access the heart through the larger deeper artery in the groin the researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach along with sameday discharge could save the united states 300 million per year we have unequivocal evidence and data that show better outcomes when we access the hearts coronary arteries and perform angioplasty through a blood vessel in the wrist rather than through the femoral artery in the groin said first author amit p amin md an assistant professor of medicine the femoral artery is the traditional route but when we go in through a vessel in the wrist we see less bleeding fewer complications less pain and discomfort higher patient satisfaction shorter hospital stays and lower costs patients may undergo coronary angioplasty also called percutaneous coronary intervention pci to alleviate chest pain or shortness of breath such symptoms suggest the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart are blocked or narrowed and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle is reduced interventional cardiologists insert a small tube into an artery in the wrist or the groin which can be used to view the narrowed heart artery deliver an inflatable balloon to open up the narrowed section and possibly deliver a stent to hold the vessel open using the national cardiovascular data registry cathpci registry the researchers analyzed data from almost 280000 medicare patients who underwent pci and were eligible for sameday discharge despite the fact that all of these patients were capable of leaving the hospital the same day as their procedures only about 5 percent of these patients actually were discharged without having stayed overnight we have seen that it is very safe to send these patients home the same day said amin who treats patients at barnesjewish hospital we use riskprediction models to predict their risks ahead of time and we plan ahead to mitigate any issues so we can facilitate a sameday discharge this is really about patient care we want to outline healthcare pathways that provide the best care for patients the analysis demonstrated an average cost of 13389 for the wrist approach with sameday discharge compared with 17076 for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization resulting in a cost savings of about 3700 for outpatients who get the wristaccess procedure independent of the length of stay the wrist approach costs about 900 less than the groin approach on average the investigators estimated that if a hospital performing 1000 of these procedures annually shifted 30 percent of these patients to the wristaccess with sameday discharge approach the hospital would save 1 million over that period expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the united states 300 million in healthcare spending per year healthcare costs for the 600000 patients who receive pci each year in the us are estimated to be 10 billion of the studys patient population receiving pci 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access according to amin improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries even for complex cases and should be considered for more patients the traditional way has been to go through the bigger femoral artery that is a straight pathway to the heart amin said unfortunately that artery is also deep its associated with more bleeding complications in contrast the wrist artery is small and is associated with fewer complications the minor challenge is in the difficulty of navigating a smaller more twisting path of an artery through the wrist but with advances we have in technology and equipment those challenges are rapidly decreasing

real,a new study from karolinska institutet in sweden shows that shortcourse preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse sideeffects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy the results are presented in the journal the lancet oncology rectal cancer affects some 2000 men and women in sweden every year preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer says principal investigator anna martling senior consultant surgeon and professor at karolinska institutets department of molecular medicine and surgery thanks to our results radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients however radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted the study now presented in the lancet oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery these hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms standard therapy ie shortcourse 5x5 gy radiotherapy with direct surgery within a week delayed surgery with shortcourse 5x5 gy radiotherapy followed by surgery after 48 weeks delayed surgery with longcourse 25x2 gy radiotherapy followed by surgery after 48 weeks the results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes it also showed that there is no difference between longcourse and shortcourse radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment the results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients says professor martling the results can now be immediately put to clinical use to the considerable benefit of the patients
real,ann arbor michigan even as treatment options for laryngeal cancer seemed to improve survival rates did not for the most advanced patients 50 percent survival was the norm whether patients had surgery to totally remove the voice box or alternative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to try to avoid surgery but the head and neck oncology team at the university of michigan comprehensive cancer center came up with a different approach give patients a single dose of chemotherapy and see who responds to it the responders can continue with combination chemotherapy and radiation the nonresponders can be referred immediately for surgery after a decade of using this approach researchers are reporting exceptional survival rates nearing 80 percent even for the most advanced patients the team published their outcomes in jama otolaryngology head and neck surgery in trying to match the biology of the tumor to the treatment all of the patients get better outcomes says study author gregory t wolf md professor and chair emeritus of otolaryngology head and neck surgery at michigan medicine this approach allows us to enhance quality of life for all of our patients many patients can spare their voice box by having chemotherapy and radiation but thats only good if the treatment works for patients who must go on to receive surgery by selecting them up front we can spare them the complications that may occur when the voice box is removed following multiple cycles of chemotherapy with radiation adds study author francis worden md professor of hematologyoncology the michigan medicine team first tested the idea in 1995 they found that patients whose tumor shrunk by more than half after one round of chemotherapy were more likely to do well with chemotherapy and radiation and have an excellent chance of saving their voice box if the tumor did not respond after that first dose patients would likely fail on the chemotherapy and would do better going straight to surgery in a clinical trial they saw diseasespecific survival rates of 80 percent in patients with advanced disease this was unheard of and it wasnt just those who responded to the chemotherapy the nonresponders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too we adopted the treatment approach and started offering it to all our laryngeal cancer patients wolf says as part of a specialized program of research excellence or spore grant the team was already maintaining longterm followup data on patients wolf suggested they look back and see if they were still maintaining such strong outcomes with this approach the results surprised even him over 10 years 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at michigan medicine with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy the remainder elected to proceed straight to surgery or chemoradiation without the induction dose average disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemoradiation without the induction strategy this adds ammunition to the idea that we need to pick individual therapies more carefully both chemoradiation and surgery are difficult treatments with their share of challenging longterm effects but if we tailor treatments to the individual biology of the tumor and characteristics of the patient well get the best results wolf says the study did find lower functional preservation of the larynx in the induction chemotherapy group compared to those who elected chemoradiation twothirds of the induction group achieved organ preservation while more than threequarters of the chemoradiation patients did wolf notes however that chemoradiation often severely damages the larynx which may cause problems with eating or swallowing years later the induction approach can be done anywhere but requires intense collaboration among surgeons medical oncologists and radiation oncologists all three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy even that single dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients wolf hopes future research will reveal a way to tailor treatment without the need for the induction chemotherapy
real,a new biologic agentthe most potent of its kind so faris showing early promise as part of a potential new strategy for treating hiv the drug known as 101074 may also offer a new way to prevent viral infection in people who are at high risk to acquire hiv the virus that causes aids the drug belongs to a class of molecules called broadly neutralizing antibodies which are naturally found in hivinfected people whose immune systems have a rare ability to fight off the virus these antibodies are a major area of study in the laboratory of rockefeller university investigator michel nussenzweig who is zanvil a cohn and ralph m steinman professor and head of the laboratory of molecular immunology marina caskey an assistant professor of clinical investigation leads clinical studies on these antibodies this was the first human trial of 101074 says till schoofs an instructor in clinical investigation in nussenzweigs lab the antibody binds to a different part of the virus than the other antibody weve studied in addition its one of the most potent broadly neutralizing antibodies described to date today hiv is typically treated with antiretroviral therapy a drug regimen that became available in the 1990s although it has been a lifesaver for people infected with the virus antiretroviral medications have significant drawbacks they can cause severe side effects and patients have to take them for life this is why researchers continue to look for other ways to control the virusand broadly neutralizing antibodies could prove to be part of an alternate treatment strategy the study of 101074 an earlystage clinical trial included 19 individuals who were infected with hiv and 14 who were not the purpose was to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans the majority of the people in the trial were enrolled at the rockefeller university hospital while some of the hiv1 infected participants received the antibody at the university of cologne in germany it has been challenging to find trial participants with high levels of the virus here in new york caskey says so our collaboration with the university of cologne has been very valuable the investigators found that among 13 hivinfected people who received the highest dose of 101074 11 showed a rapid decline in the amount of virus although these patients were found to have some resistant virus in their blood further research in the lab showed that those viruses were still sensitive to other broadly neutralizing antibodies including 3bnc117 that target different parts of the pathogen the results were published in january in nature medicine caskey schoofs and their team also analyzed the uninfected participants blood samples and found that 101074 may be an effective way to prevent infection in people who are exposed to the virus currently people who do not have hiv but are at substantial risk of getting itbecause they have multiple sexual partners for example or an hivinfected partnercan receive antiviral medications to prevent disease a strategy called preexposure prophylaxis prep but just like the antiviral medications used to treat infection prep can have severe side effects and must be taken daily to be effective which poses significant challenges to adequate compliance based on our findings we think these types of antibodies could be a viable substitute for the drugs currently used in prep says caskey but to clearly demonstrate that these antibodies have an advantage over the pill thats currently used we would need to test them in large numbers of people and show that they remain active for a prolonged period of time in the body in an effort to accomplish this the investigators are looking into modified variants of the antibodies with prolonged activity so that they would need to be given less often in the prep setting and they are already moving forward with new clinical studies using 101074 together with 3bnc117 with the hope that combining two antibodies targeting different parts of hiv will be more effective than either antibody on its own
real,chicago january 26 2017 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease known as gerd who undergo laparoscopic antireflux operations compared with traditional open operations suffer fewer postoperative complications experience faster recovery and incur lower health care costs according to study results published online as an article in press on the journal of the american college of surgeons website ahead of print publication gerd affects nearly 20 percent of american adults according to the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases heartburn a burning sensation in the chest is a common symptom of gerd patients with gerd have an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter which allows gastric acid to go back up into the esophagus said lead study author francisco schlottmann md a surgeon at the center for esophageal diseases and swallowing university of north carolina chapel hill antireflux surgery should be considered in patients who do not achieve complete control of their symptoms regurgitation or cough with medications who do not want to take medications for the rest of their lives or who experience complications of medical therapy for the study researchers analyzed data in the national inpatient sample nis database of more than 75000 adults who underwent either laparoscopic or open fundoplication for gerd between 2000 and 2013 nis represents 1000 us hospitals and contains data on more than seven million hospitalizations each year during the study period 584 percent of patients underwent laparoscopic procedures and 416 percent had open antireflux operations performed through a long abdominal incision the study showed that the rate of laparoscopic procedures increased from 248 percent in 2000 to 843 percent in 2013 surprisingly in 2003 12 years after the first laparoscopic antireflux operation was reported only 25 percent of all the antireflux operations were performed laparoscopically in the us dr schlottmann said subsequently the rate increased but 15 percent of all antireflux operations were still being performed through an open approach in 2013 we believe this percentage is very high and we hope that in the next year this percentage will decrease along with discovering that the use of laparoscopy for the surgical treatment of gerd has increased significantly in the last decade the researchers also found that on average the minimally invasive approach reduced length of hospital stay by approximately two days and open operations were more than 9000 more expensive than minimally invasive procedures the researchers also found that laparoscopic procedures were better for patients in terms of fewer complications laparoscopic antireflux operations were less likely to result in postoperative blood clots wound complications surgical site infection esophageal perforation which can be life threatening bleeding cardiac failure and death our study highlights the fact that laparoscopic antireflux surgery is as effective as the open approach and in 2017 with all its advantages should be the standard of care said senior study author marco g patti md facs a surgeon and director of the center for esophageal diseases and swallowing university of north carolina chapel hill we found that laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly lower costs in addition indirect costs of the open approach including an impaired ability to work time off from work and intangible costs of postoperative pain and healing are difficult to measure but also favor the laparoscopic approach said dr patti gerd is a common digestive disorder that can usually be treated with dietary changes and medications such as proton pump inhibitors ppis however chronic and notcontrolled gerd can cause serious complications repeated exposure to stomach acid can damage the lining of the esophagus and lead to a precancerous condition called barretts esophagus said dr schlottmann study results also revealed that urban academic or teaching hospitals performed laparoscopic antireflux surgery at a higher rate than open procedures 544 percent versus 456 percent we think that it is important to make this information more available to the public in order to achieve good outcomes antireflux surgery should be performed laparoscopically in specialized centers said dr patti

real,amsterdam the netherlands a test that measures the levels of five chemicals in the breath has shown promising results for the detection of cancers of the oesophagus and stomach in a large patient trial presented at the european cancer congress 2017 1 together stomach and oesophageal cancer account for around 14 million new cancer diagnoses each year worldwide 2 both tend to be diagnosed late because the symptoms are ambiguous meaning the fiveyear survival rate for these two types of cancer is only 15 the new research involving more than 300 patients showed that the test could diagnose cancer with an overall accuracy of 85 dr sheraz markar an nihr clinical trials fellow from imperial college london under the supervision of professor george hanna told the congress at present the only way to diagnose oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy this method is expensive invasive and has some risk of complications a breath test could be used as a noninvasive firstline test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies in the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment and better survival the trial was based on the results of previous research that suggested differences in the levels of specific chemicals butyric pentanoic and hexanoic acids butanal and decanal between patients with stomach or oesophageal cancer and patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without cancer the new research aimed to test whether this chemical signature that seemed to typify cancer could be the basis of a diagnostic test in the new study the research team collected breath samples from 335 people at st marys hospital imperial college healthcare nhs trust university college london hospital and the royal marsden hospital london of these 163 had been diagnosed with stomach or oesophageal cancer and 172 showed no evidence of cancer when they had an endoscopy all the samples were analysed with a technique called selected ion flowtube mass spectrometry which is able to accurately measure small amounts of different chemicals in mixtures of gases such as breath researchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the chemical signature that indicated cancer the results showed that the test was 85 accurate overall with a sensitivity of 80 and a specificity of 81 this means that not only was the breath test good at picking up those who had cancer sensitivity it was also good at correctly identifying who did not have cancer specificity dr markar said because cancer cells are different to healthy ones they produce a different mixture of chemicals this study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the oesophagus and stomach and which do not however these findings must be validated in a larger sample of patients before the test could be used in the clinic over the next three years the researchers will continue with a larger trial using the test with patients who are being given an endoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms but not yet diagnosed with cancer this will assess the ability of the test to pick up cases within a group that is likely to contain only a small percentage of cancers the team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer such as colorectal and pancreatic which could be used as firstline tests in general practice surgeries
real,columbus ohio antiinflammatory diets which tend to be high in vegetables fruits fish and whole grains could boost bone health and prevent fractures in some women a new study suggests researchers examined data from the landmark womens health initiative to compare levels of inflammatory elements in the diet to bone mineral density and fractures and found new associations between food and bone health the study led by tonya orchard an assistant professor of human nutrition at the ohio state university appears in the journal of bone and mineral research women with the leastinflammatory diets based on a scoring system called the dietary inflammatory index lost less bone density during the sixyear followup period than their peers with the mostinflammatory diets this was despite the fact that they started off with lower bone density overall furthermore diets with low inflammatory potential appeared to correspond to lower risk of hip fracture among one subgroup of the study postmenopausal white women younger than 63 the findings suggest that womens bone health could benefit when they choose a diet higher in beneficial fats plants and whole grains said orchard who is part of ohio states food innovation center this suggests that as women age healthy diets are impacting their bones orchard said i think this gives us yet another reason to support the recommendations for a healthy diet in the dietary guidelines for americans because the study was observational its not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes rebecca jackson the studys senior author and director of ohio states center for clinical and translational science said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk by looking at the full diet rather than individual nutrients these data provide a foundation for studying how components of the diet might interact to provide benefit and better inform womens health and lifestyle choices said jackson who is national chair of the womens health initiative steering committee previous studies have connected high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood to bone loss and to fractures in older women and men which prompted orchard and her colleagues to wonder what theyd find if they took one more step back to the dietary choices that contribute to inflammation in the body the dietary inflammatory index developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed helped them accomplish that dietary information as well as data on bone density and fracture were collected from a large group of the participants in the womens health initiative the largest study of postmenopausal womens health undertaken in us history participants in the whi were 50 to 79 when they enrolled in the study of prevention and control of common diseases impacting older women enrollment ran from 1993 to 1998 for the new analysis the first of its kind the research team looked at dietary data from 160191 women and assigned inflammation scores based on 32 food components that the women reported consuming in the three months prior to their enrollment the researchers used bonemineraldensity data from a subset of 10290 women fracture data was collected for the entire study group orchard and her colleagues found a correlation only between highinflammatory diets and fracture in younger white women in the study higher scores were associated with an almost 50 percent larger risk of hip fracture in caucasian women younger than 63 compared with the risk for women in the group with the lowest inflammatory scores this suggests that a highquality lessinflammatory diet may be especially important in reducing hip fracture risk in younger women the researchers wrote but in the study group overall moreinflammatory diets were not linked to fracture and in fact the researchers found a modestly lower risk of lowerarm and total fracture in women with the highest dietary inflammation scores one possible explanation included in the study the women with lower inflammation scores were more physically active as a group and therefore were at a slightly greater risk of falls women with the leastinflammatory diets had lower bone mineral density overall at the start of the study but lost less bone than their highinflammation peers the researchers found the lower bone density to start could be because women with healthier diets are more likely to be of a smaller build orchard said larger people have higher bone density to support their larger frames these women with healthier diets didnt lose bone as quickly as those with highinflammation diets and this is important because after menopause women see a drastic loss in bone density that contributes to fractures orchard said

real,using data from a national study johns hopkins researchers determined that using heart ct scans can help personalize treatment in patients whose blood pressure falls in the gray zone of just above normal or mild high blood pressure previously the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they dont need nearly one in three adults in the us has prehypertension blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet the scans detect levels of calcium in the hearts arteries and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively depending on their other heart disease risk factors in the study published on jan 10 in circulation the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient if a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and abovenormal blood pressure he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions says j william mcevoy mbbch mhs assistant professor of medicine and member of the ciccarone center for the prevention of heart disease at the johns hopkins university school of medicine our study along with others such as sprint and hope positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target in late 2015 the sprint trial showed improved outcomes for participants with increased risk for heart disease whose physicians targeted their systolic the top number blood pressures to 120 millimeters of mercury rather than the traditional 140 millimeters of mercury but not all people deemed higher risk by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated mcevoy says some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects such as sexual dysfunction dizziness falls weakness and more and the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level says mcevoy we can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack but the equations dont tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15 they dont give us personalized information says mcevoy conventionally coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians decisions of whether to put a patient on statins but the researchers say they havent been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment to determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too the researchers used data from 3733 participants in the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis mesa who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury participants were an average of 65 years old and 48 percent were men thirtyfive percent were white 32 percent were africanamerican 22 percent were hispanic and 11 percent were chineseamerican at the beginning of the study investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac ct scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores they also calculated each participants heart disease risk with the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk algorithm which uses traditional risk factors such as race age sex cholesterol levels and family history of disease about once a year for 10 years an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis hospitalizations or deaths after about 10 years the participants had 642 heart disease events such as heart attack heart failure stroke and death the researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups those with a score of zero those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100 then they looked at the number of heart diseaserelated events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event to get the event rate the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study known as a personyear participants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10year study for example according to the researchers those with systolic blood pressures below 140 millimeters of mercury and no calcium had an event rate of 127 events per 1000 personyears and similar people with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 159 millimeters of mercury had an event rate of 136 events per 1000 personyears in contrast participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury below the current cutoff for treatment and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 197 events per 1000 personyears thus even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment participants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1000 personyears regardless of their calcium scores the researchers say this demonstrates that calcium scores may only be useful in guiding more personalized blood pressure treatment for patients with mild high blood pressure the gray zone not those with high blood pressure it may be that if patients are in that blood pressure treatment gray zone with a high risk score but their coronary artery calcium score is zero then they dont need to be treated aggressively to 120 millimeters of mercury and can be treated to 140 instead says mcevoy but if patients have a high calcium score and are in the gray zone then it would make sense to go with 120 as a treatment goal the researchers caution that results are from an observational study and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations coronary artery calcium scans arent usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from 100 to 400 the scans use radiation so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals about 70 million adults in the us have high blood pressure a systolic blood pressure over 140 millimeters of mercury putting them at increased risk for heart attacks stroke heart failure and kidney disease according to the us centers for disease control and prevention
real,a new pilot study led by mclean hospitals ipsit vahia md medical director of geriatric psychiatry outpatient services at mclean hospital suggests that the use of tablet computers is both a safe and a potentially effective approach to managing agitation among patients with dementia tablet use as a nonpharmacologic intervention for agitation in older adults including those with severe dementia appears to be feasible safe and of potential utility said vahia our preliminary results are a first step in developing muchneeded empirical data for clinicians and caregivers on how to use technology such as tablets as tools to enhance care and also for app developers working to serve the technologic needs of this population use of tablet devices in the management of agitation among inpatients with dementia an open label study was recently published in the online version of the american journal of geriatric psychiatry this research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art music and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication by using tablet devices to employ these therapies however patients and providers also benefit from a computers inherent flexibility the biggest advantage is versatility said vahia we know that art therapy can work music therapy can work the tablet however gives you the option of switching from one app to another easily modifying the therapy seamlessly to suit the individual you dont need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure researchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study the apps were freely available on itunes and varied greatly in their cognitive complexityfrom an app that displayed puppy photos to one that featured sudoku puzzles the researchers found that tablet use was safe for every patient regardless of the severity of their dementia and that with proper supervision and training the engagement rate with the devices was nearly 100 percent the study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation particularlybut not exclusivelyamong patients with milder forms of dementia vahia cited several examples of the tablets potential to improve a patients condition one particular patient who only spoke romanian was very withdrawn and irritable and medications were ineffective in controlling his symptoms we started showing him romanian video clips on youtube and his behavior changed dramatically and instantaneously said vahia his mood improved he became more interactive he and his medical support team also started using a translation app so that staff could ask him simple questions in romanian facilitating increased interaction these significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablets potential as a clinical tool based on such promising outcomes the geriatric psychiatry outpatient services clinical team is expanding the use of tablet devices as a means to control agitation in dementia patients at mclean this will allow researchers to develop more robust data and expand the scope of the study including a focus on specific clinical factors that may impact how patients with dementia engage with and respond to apps
real,chicago soon you can seek mental health advice on your smartphone as quickly as finding a good restaurant a novel suite of 13 speedy miniapps called intellicare resulted in participants reporting significantly less depression and anxiety by using the apps on their smartphones up to four times a day reports a new northwestern medicine study the apps offer exercises to destress reduce selfcriticism and worrying methods to help your life feel more meaningful mantras to highlight your strengths strategies for a good nights sleep and more most apps designed for mental health typically offer a single strategy to feel better or provide too many features that make them difficult to navigate users may get bored or overwhelmed and may stop using the apps after a few weeks but participants robustly used the intellicare interactive apps as many as four times daily or an average of 195 times for eight weeks of the study they spent an average of one minute using each app with longer times for apps with relaxation videos the 96 participants who completed the research study reported that they experienced about a 50 percent decrease in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms the shortterm studyrelated reductions are comparable to results expected in clinical practice using psychotherapy or with that seen using antidepressant medication the study will be published jan 5 in the journal of medical internet research we designed these apps so they fit easily into peoples lives and could be used as simply as apps to find a restaurant or directions said lead study author david mohr professor of preventive medicine and director of the center for behavioral intervention technologies at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine some of the participants kept using them after the study because they felt that the apps helped them feel better mohr said there were many apps to try during the study so there was a sense of novelty participants had access to the 13 intellicare apps from google play and received eight weeks of coaching for the use of intellicare coaching included an initial phone call plus two or more text messages per week over the eight weeks in the study 105 participants were enrolled and 96 of them completed the study the preliminary study did not include a control arm so its possible that some people who enrolled in the trial would have improved anyway partly because they may have been motivated to try something new mohr said he now has launched a larger trial recruiting 300 participants with a control arm some of the intellicare apps include daily feats designed to motivate you to add worthwhile and rewarding activities into your day to increase your overall satisfaction in life purple chill designed to help you unwind with audio recordings that guide you through exercises to destress and worry less slumber time designed to ease you into a good nights rest my mantra designed to help you create motivating mantras to highlight your strengths and values using digital tools for mental health is emerging as an important part of our future mohr said these are designed to help the millions of people who want support but cant get to a therapists office more than 20 percent of americans have significant symptoms of depression or anxiety each year but only around 20 percent of people with a mental health problem get adequate treatment the intellicare algorithm recommends new apps each week to keep the experience fresh provide new opportunities for learning skills and avoid user boredom although the apps are not validated each one was designed by northwestern clinicians and based on validated techniques used by therapists intellicare is a national research study individuals can download the apps free with no financial obligation but northwestern researchers hope participants will provide confidential feedback via four weekly questions that will be used to further develop the system the data will help the system make even better recommendations and provide more personalized treatment people also may enroll in a study in which they will be paid to provide even more feedback some also will have access to an intellicare coach via text messaging and phone calls who are available to support them in using the apps we now have evidence these approaches will likely work mohr said they are designed to teach many of the same skills therapists teach patients different apps are expected to work for different people the goal is to find whats right for you
real,even experts can be fooled by melanoma people with this type of skin cancer often have molelooking growths on their skin that tend to be irregular in shape and color and can be hard to tell apart from benign ones making the disease difficult to diagnose now researchers at the rockefeller university have developed an automated technology that combines imaging with digital analysis and machine learning to help physicians detect melanoma at its early stages there is a real need for standardization across the field of dermatology in how melanomas are evaluated says james krueger d martin carter professor in clinical investigation and head of the laboratory of investigative dermatology detection through screening saves lives but is very challenging visually and even when a suspicious lesion is extracted and biopsied it is confirmed to be melanoma in only about 10 percent of cases in the new approach images of lesions are processed by a series of computer programs that extract information about the number of colors present in a growth and other quantitative data the analysis generates an overall risk score called a qscore which indicates the likelihood that the growth is cancerous published in experimental dermatology a recent study evaluating the tools usefulness indicates that the qscore yields 98 percent sensitivity meaning it is very likely to correctly identify early melanomas on the skin the ability of the test to correctly diagnose normal moles was 36 percent approaching the levels achieved by expert dermatologists performing visual examinations of suspect moles under the microscope the success of the qscore in predicting melanoma is a marked improvement over competing technologies says daniel gareau first author of the report and instructor in clinical investigation in the krueger laboratory the researchers developed this tool by feeding 60 photos of cancerous melanomas and an equivalent batch of pictures of benign growths into image processing programs they developed imaging biomarkers to precisely quantify visual features of the growths using computational methods they generated a set of quantitative metrics that differed between the two groups of imagesessentially identifying what visual aspects of the lesion mattered most in terms of malignancyand gave each biomarker a malignancy rating by combining the data from each biomarker they calculated the overall qscore for each image a value between zero and one in which a higher number indicates a higher probability of a lesion being a cancerous as previous studies have shown the number of colors in a lesion turned out to be the most significant biomarker for determining malignancy and some biomarkers were significant only if looked at in specific color channelsa finding the researchers say could potentially be exploited to identify additional biomarkers and further improve accuracy i think this technology could help detect the disease earlier which could save lives and avoid unnecessary biopsies too says gareau our next steps are to evaluate this method in larger studies and take a closer look at how we can use specific color wavelengths to reveal aspects of the lesions that may be invisible to the human eye but could still be useful in diagnosis this work was supported in part by the national institutes of health and in part by the paul and irma milstein family foundation and the american skin association researchers develop automated melanoma detector for skin cancer screening
real,an experimental ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in guinea according to results published today in the lancet the vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year 1 the vaccine called rvsvzebov 2 was studied in a trial involving 11841 people in guinea during 2015 among the 5837 people who received the vaccine no ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination 3 in comparison there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine the trial was led by the world health organization together with guineas ministry of health and other international partners while these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during west africas ebola epidemic they show that when the next ebola outbreak hits we will not be defenceless said dr mariepaule kieny whos assistant directorgeneral for health systems and innovation and the studys lead author 4 the vaccines manufacturer merck sharpe dohme this year received breakthrough therapy designation from the united states food and drug administration and prime status from the european medicines agency enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted since ebola virus was first identified in 1976 sporadic outbreaks have been reported in africa but the 20132016 west african ebola outbreak which resulted in more than 11300 deaths highlighted the need for a vaccine the trial took place in the coastal region of basseguine the area of guinea still experiencing new ebola cases when the trial started in 2015 the trial used an innovative design a socalled ring vaccination approach the same method used to eradicate small pox when a new ebola case was diagnosed the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks such as people who lived in the same household were visited by the patient or were in close contact with the patient their clothes or linen as well as certain contacts of contacts a total of 117 clusters or rings were identified each made up of an average of 80 people initially rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3week delay and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine after interim results were published showing the vaccines efficacy all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years in addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach socalled herd immunity however the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect so more research will be needed ebola left a devastating legacy in our country we are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured said dr keta sakoba coordinator of the ebola response and director of the national agency for health security in guinea 4 to assess safety people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination including headache fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without longterm effects two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis and one was judged to be possibly related influenzalike illness all three recovered without any long term effects it was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline ebola workers in guinea this both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination the contribution of many experts worldwide and strong local involvement said dr johnarne rttingen specialist director at the norwegian institute of public health and the chairman of the study steering group 4 in january gavi the vaccine alliance provided us5 million to merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved prequalified and recommended by who as part of this agreement merck committed

real,nacetylcysteine reduced ptsd symptoms cravings and depression in veterans with ptsd and substance use disorder in a randomized controlled pilot trial conducted at the medical university of south carolina and the ralph h johnson va medical center nacetylcysteine when combined with group cognitive behavioral therapy cbt reduced symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd cravings and depression significantly more than cbt alone in veterans with cooccurring ptsd and substance use disorder a particularly difficulttotreat population according to the findings of a randomized controlled pilot trial conducted by researchers at the medical university of south carolina musc and the ralph h johnson va medical center this trial is the first to use nac as a pharmacotherapy for ptsd and a broad range of suds the results were published online ahead of print on october 11 2016 by the journal of clinical psychiatry the national center for ptsd estimates that seven to eight percent of americans will have ptsd at some point in their life the numbers are even worse for veterans it is estimated for example that 30 percent of vietnam veterans will have experienced ptsd at some point in their life approximately 40 to 50 percent of veterans with ptsd also have a substance use disorder sud addiction goes along with virtually every psychiatric disorder at a higher percentage than it does in the general population said peter w kalivas phd the senior author on the article and chair of the department of neuroscience at musc people who are prone to psychiatric disorders are also prone to addiction currently there are no wellexplored pharmacological treatments for patients with cooccurring ptsdsud although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been approved by the fda for treatment of ptsd pharmacological treatments for cooccurring ptsdsud have yielded suboptimal results groundbreaking basic science research by kalivas has shown that levels of glutamate transporters are decreased in suds and that administration of the antioxidant nacetylcysteine can help restore those levels and guard against relapse in animal models of sud because evidence suggests that suds and ptsd share overlapping neurobiological pathways sudie e back phd lead author on the article hypothesized that nac treatment with cbt would be a novel approach to treat cooccurring ptsd and sud back is a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at musc and a staff psychologist at the ralph h johnson va medical center in the eightweek randomized controlled trial led by back and kalivas 35 veterans with ptsd and sud all of whom were receiving cognitive behavioral therapy cbt for their sud were randomized to either 2400 mgday of nac or placebo the average age of the veterans was 49 years and many were veterans of the vietnam war to be included veterans had to have abstained from substance use for at least seven days of the veterans enrolled in the trial 83 completed it a very high rate for this difficulttotreat population veterans in the nactreated group showed a 46 reduction in ptsd symptoms compared with a 25 reduction in the placebo group on the clinicaladministered ptsd scale caps which assesses trauma history and symptom severity the threshold caps score for diagnosis of ptsd is 50 as a group the nactreated veterans were below diagnostic level for ptsd at the end of treatment said back for ptsd these are some of the best outcomes we have seen in the literature for a medication craving and depression were also reduced in the nactreated group the amount of craving was reduced by 81 and the frequency of craving by 71 in the nac group compared with 32 and 29 in the placebo group craving is a key component of substance use in relapse said back if you have a medication that can really reduce craving that will go a long way to helping people stay clean and sober depression gauged using the beck depression inventory was reduced 48 in the nac group vs 15 in the placebo group veterans in the study had low rates of substance use during the trial and the study found little effect of medication on use perhaps due to the fact that all participants were receiving sud treatment and exhibiting low levels of use this finding could also be due to the relatively limited number of participants or to the chronic nature of the participants ptsd this is a tough patient population with sud to work with said kalivas we have vietnam vets that have had ptsd for 15 to 20 years this is not an easytoturnaround population although these early promising findings show that nac reduced ptsd symptoms craving and depression nac should not be used as a monotherapy or substitute for evidencebased behavioral treatment but instead be seen as an adjunct therapy that enhances it we would not advocate using it instead of therapy said back but this could be something to help prevent relapse when used alongside a behavioral treatment nac is available over the counter and does not cause side effects at the doses used in the study but it degrades quickly when stored is contraindicated in patients with asthma and can cause nausea at higher doses and so should always be obtained and administered under a physicians supervision the next steps in backs research are to run a longerterm trial of nac in veterans with ptsd and sud and to use mrs magnetic spectroscopy to better explore the effect of nac on glutamate levels in patients with ptsd and sud

real,jacksonville fla researchers at mayo clinics campus in florida have conducted the worlds first prospective blinded and placebocontrolled clinical study to test the benefit of using bone marrow stem cells a regenerative medicine therapy to reduce arthritic pain and disability in knees the researchers say such testing is needed because there are at least 600 stem cell clinics in the us offering one form of stem cell therapy or another to an estimated 100000plus patients who pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for the treatment which has not undergone demanding clinical study the findings in the american journal of sports medicine include an anomalous finding patients not only had a dramatic improvement in the knee that received stem cells but also in their other knee which also had painful arthritis but received only a saline control injection each of the 25 patients enrolled in the study had two bad knees but did not know which knee received the stem cells given that the stem celltreated knee was no better than the controltreated knee both were significantly better than before the study began the researchers say the stem cells effectiveness remains somewhat uninterpretable they are only able to conclude the procedure is safe to undergo as an option for knee pain but they cannot yet recommend it for routine arthritis care our findings can be interpreted in ways that we now need to test one of which is that bone marrow stem cell injection in one ailing knee can relieve pain in both affected knees in a systemic or wholebody fashion says the studys lead author shane shapiro md a mayo clinic orthopedic physician journalists sound bites with dr shane shapiro are available in the downloads below media contact kevin punsky mayo clinic public affairs 9049530746 punskykevin edu one hypothesis is that the stem cells we tested can home to areas of injury where they are needed which makes sense given that stem cells injected intravenously in cancer treatments end up in the patients bone marrow where they need to go he says this is just a theory that can explain our results so it needs further testing another explanation is that merely injecting any substance into a knee offered relief from pain that could be but both this idea and the notion that a placebo effect could be involved would be surprising given that some patients are still doing very well years after their study treatment ended says dr shapiro he adds that these findings are important because while use of a patients own stem cells for regenerative therapy is extraordinarily popular the treatments may be untested and are often poorly regulated stem cell clinics often offer expensive treatments for conditions that range from multiple sclerosis lung and heart disease to cosmetic treatments such as facelifts none of these techniques have been studied because clinics maintain that use of a patients own cells is not a drug but depending on how they are processed and used stem cells can in fact be regulated by the us food and drug administration as biological products or drugs requiring rigorous safety and efficacy approval processes in early september the fda held scientific meetings to clarify how to regulate such practices mayo clinic researchers developed their study with fda approval we feel that if we are going to offer any stem cell procedures to our patients the science needs to be worked out dr shapiro says the study was conducted in mayos human cell therapy lab researchers extracted 60 to 90 milliliters of bone marrow from each patient then filtered it removed all blood cells and concentrated it down to 4 to 5 milliliters the solution which contained tens of thousands of stem cells was injected into a patients knee using ultrasoundguided imagery we actually counted all of the stem cells with markers that are accepted by the fda and we made sure they would be able to survive inside the patient dr shapiro says counting is expensive most clinics just draw the cells from bone marrow or fat and inject them back into the patient without checking for stem cells hoping that patients get better he says dr shapiro and his colleagues are currently designing new studies that will test whether the stem cells home to distant areas of injuries as well as exploring other implications suggested in their findings study investigators include mayo clinic in florida senior author mary l oconnor md shari e kazmerchak michael g heckman and abba c zubair md phd dr oconnor is now at yale university funding for this study was from mayo clinics center for regenerative medicine

significantly lessens mental anguish in distressed cancer patients for months at a time according to results of a clinical trial led by researchers at nyu langone medical center published in the journal of psychopharmacology online dec1 the study showed that onetime treatment with the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin whose use required federal waivers because it is a banned substance quickly brought relief from distress that then lasted for more than six months in 80 percent of the 29 study subjects monitored based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression the nyu langoneled study was published side by side with a similar study from johns hopkins study results were also endorsed in 11 accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry addiction and palliative care our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy with the potential to transform care for patients with cancerrelated psychological distress says study lead investigator stephen ross md director of substance abuse services in the department of psychiatry at nyu langone if larger clinical trials prove successful then we could ultimately have available a safe effective and inexpensive medication dispensed under strict control to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients says ross also an associate professor of psychiatry at nyu school of medicine study coinvestigator jeffrey guss md a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at nyu langone notes that psilocybin has been studied for decades and has an established safety profile study participants he says experienced no serious negative effects such as hospitalization or more serious mental health conditions although the neurological benefits of psilocybin are not completely understood it has been proven to activate parts of the brain also impacted by the signaling chemical serotonin which is known to control mood and anxiety serotonin imbalances have also been linked to depression for the study half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive a 03 milligrams per kilogram dose of psilocybin while the rest received a vitamin placebo 250 milligrams of niacin known to produce a rush that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience approximately half way through the studys monitoring period after seven weeks all participants switched treatments those who initially received psilocybin took a single dose of placebo and those who first took niacin then received psilocybin neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo guss says the randomization placebo control and doubleblind procedures maximized the validity of the study results one of the key findings was that improvements in clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression lasted for the remainder of the studys extended monitoring period specifically eight months for those who took psilocybin first all patients in the study mostly women age 22 to 75 who are or were patients at the perlmutter cancer center of nyu langone had either advanced breast gastrointestinal or blood cancers and had been diagnosed as suffering from serious psychological distress related to their disease all patients who volunteered to be part of the study were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist psychologist nurse or social worker and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state coinvestigator anthony bossis phd a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at nyu langone says patients also reported postpsilocybin improvements in their quality of life going out more greater energy getting along better with family members and doing well at work several also reported variations of spirituality unusual peacefulness and increased feelings of altruism our study showed that psilocybin facilitated experiences that drove reductions in psychological distress says bossis and if its true for cancer care then it could apply to other stressful medical conditions bossis cautions that patients should not consume psilocybin on their own or without supervision by a physician and a trained counselor he also says psilocybin therapy may not work for everyone and some groups such as people with schizophrenia as well as adolescents should not be treated with it both the nyu langone and johns hopkins studies were principally funded by the heffter research institute a nonprofit scientific institution with the principal mission of helping to design review and

depression found considerable relief for up to six months from a single large dose of psilocybin the active compound in hallucinogenic magic mushrooms the researchers cautioned that the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions in the presence of two clinically trained monitors and said they do not recommend use of the compound outside of such a research or patient care setting the johns hopkins team released its study results involving 51 adult patients concurrently with researchers from new york university langone medical center who conducted a similarly designed study on 29 participants both studies are published in the journal of psychopharmacology on dec 1 the johns hopkins group reported that psilocybin decreased clinician and patientrated depressed mood anxiety and death anxiety and increased quality of life life meaning and optimism six months after the final session of treatment about 80 percent of participants continued to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety with about 60 percent showing symptom remission into the normal range eightythree percent reported increases in wellbeing or life satisfaction some 67 percent of participants reported the experience as one of the top five meaningful experiences in their lives and about 70 percent reported the experience as one of the top five spiritually significant lifetime events the most interesting and remarkable finding is that a single dose of psilocybin which lasts four to six hours produced enduring decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms and this may represent a fascinating new model for treating some psychiatric conditions says roland griffiths phd professor of behavioral biology in the departments of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and of neuroscience at the johns hopkins university school of medicine he notes that traditional psychotherapy offered to people with cancer including behavioral therapy and antidepressants can take weeks or even months isnt always effective and in the case of some drugs such as benzodiazepines may have addictive and other troubling side effects griffiths says his teams new study grew out of a decade of research at johns hopkins on the effects of psilocybin in healthy volunteers which found that psilocybin can consistently produce positive changes in mood behavior and spirituality when administered to carefully screened and prepared participants the study was designed to see if psilocybin could produce similar results in psychologically distressed cancer patients a lifethreatening cancer diagnosis can be psychologically challenging with anxiety and depression as very common symptoms says griffiths people with this kind of existential anxiety often feel hopeless and are worried about the meaning of life and what happens upon death for the study the investigators recruited 51 participants diagnosed with lifethreatening cancers most of which were recurrent or metastatic they were chosen from a total of 566 individuals reached through flyers web advertisements and physician referrals most participants had breast upper digestive gi genitourinary or blood cancer and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis including an anxiety or depressive disorder half of the participants were female with an average age of 56 ninetytwo percent were white 4 percent were africanamerican and 2 percent were asian each participant had two treatment sessions scheduled five weeks apart one with a very low psilocybin dose 1 or3 milligrams per 70 kilograms taken in a capsule and meant to act as a control placebo because the dose was too low to produce effects in the other session participants received a capsule with what is considered a moderate or high dose 22 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms to minimize expectancy effects the participants and the staff members supervising the sessions were told that the participants would receive psilocybin on both sessions but they did not know that all participants would receive one high and one low dose blood pressure and mood were monitored throughout the sessions two monitors aided participants during each session encouraging them to lie down wear an eye mask listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience if anxiety or confusion arose the monitors provided reassurance to the participants in addition to experiencing changes in visual perception emotions and thinking most participants reported experiences of psychological insight and often profound deeply meaningful experiences of the interconnectedness of all people the researchers assessed each participants mood attitude about life behaviors and spirituality with questionnaires and structured interviews before the first session seven hours after taking the psilocybin five weeks after each session and six months after the second session immediately after the sessions participants completed questionnaires assessing changes in visual auditory and body perceptions feelings of transcendence changes in mood and more structured clinical interviews such as the hamilton depression rating scale and the hamilton anxiety rating scale and patient questionnaires like the beck depression inventory and the statetrait anxiety inventory assessed depression and anxiety other questionnaires assessed quality of life death acceptance meaningful existence optimism and spirituality generally defined as a search for the meaning of life and a connection to something bigger than ones self to measure the changes in attitudes moods and behavior over time the researchers administered a questionnaire that assessed negative or positive changes in attitudes about life mood and behavior with regard to adverse effects griffiths says 15 percent of participants were nauseated or vomited and onethird of participants experienced some psychological discomfort such as anxiety or paranoia after taking the higher dose onethird of the participants had transient increases in blood pressure a few participants reported headaches following the session before beginning the study it wasnt clear to me that this treatment would be helpful since cancer patients may experience profound hopelessness in response to their diagnosis which is often followed by multiple surgeries and prolonged chemotherapy says griffiths i could imagine that cancer patients would receive psilocybin look into the existential void and come out even more fearful however the positive changes in attitudes moods and behavior that we documented in healthy volunteers were replicated in cancer patients up to 40 percent of people with cancer suffer from a mood disorder according to the national comprehensive cancer network

real,newswise patients with the most lethal form of acute myeloid leukemia aml based on genetic profiles of their cancers typically survive for only four to six months after diagnosis even with aggressive chemotherapy but new research indicates that such patients paradoxically may live longer if they receive a milder chemotherapy drug treatment with the less intensive drug decitabine is not a cure but surprisingly aml patients whose leukemia cells carried mutations in a nefarious cancer gene called tp53 consistently achieved remission after treatment with decitabine their median survival was just over a year the study by a team of scientists at washington university school of medicine in st louis is published nov 24 in the new england journal of medicine in aml treatment involves intensive chemotherapy to try to kill the patients leukemia cells and put the cancer into remission if successful a followup bonemarrow transplant can offer a possible cure but this course of treatment is recommended only for patients with a high risk of relapse because the procedure can cause severe complications even death whats really unique here is that all the patients in the study with tp53 mutations had a response to decitabine and achieved an initial remission said the studys senior author timothy j ley md the lewis t and rosalind b apple professor of medicine noting that in aml tp53 mutations have been correlated with an extremely poor prognosis with standard aggressive chemotherapy we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies the findings need to be validated in a larger trial ley added but they do suggest that tp53 mutations can reliably predict responses to decitabine potentially prolonging survival in this ultra highrisk group of patients and providing a bridge to transplantation in some patients who might not otherwise be candidates in an accompanying editorial elihu estey md an aml expert at the university of washington medical center and fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle noted that aml is not one disease but many each driven by different genetic mutations the results of the current trial he said point to the inevitable need to replace large cancer clinical trials evaluating homogeneous drug treatments with smaller trials that involve subgroups of patients with treatments targeted to their specific mutations the current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the siteman cancer center at washington university school of medicine and barnesjewish hospital and at the university of chicago the patients either had aml a cancer of the bone marrow or myelodysplastic syndrome mds a group of blood cancers that often progresses to aml this year an estimated 20000 people living in the us will be diagnosed with aml and at least 11000 deaths will be attributed to the disease decitabine often is given to older patients with aml or mds because it is less toxic than standard chemotherapies but fewer than half of patients who get the drug achieve an initial remission so the researchers wanted to determine whether specific mutations in the patients cancer cells could predict their responses to treatment to find out they sequenced all the genes in patients cancer cells or analyzed select cancer genes they also conducted standard tests to look for broken missing or rearranged chromosomes then the researchers correlated these molecular markers with treatment response to identify subgroups of patients likely to benefit from decitabine among the patients in the study 46 percent achieved a remission with decitabine but remarkably all 21 patients whose leukemia cells carried tp53 mutations went into remission patients also were likely to respond to decitabine if they were deemed to have an unfavorable risk prognosis based on extensive chromosomal rearrangements in their cancer cells many of these patients also had tp53 mutations indeed 66 percent of patients with an unfavorable risk achieved remission compared with 34 percent of patients who had more favorable prognoses the challenge with using decitabine has been knowing which patients are most likely to respond said coauthor amanda cashen md an associate professor of medicine who led an earlier clinical trial of decitabine in older patients with aml the value of this study is the comprehensive mutational analysis that helps us figure out which patients are likely to benefit this information opens the door to using decitabine in a more targeted fashion to treat not just older patients but also younger patients who carry tp53 mutations first author john welch md phd an assistant professor of medicine added its important to note that patients with an extremely poor prognosis in this relatively small study had the same survival outcomes as patients facing a better prognosis which is encouraging we dont yet understand why patients with tp53 mutations consistently respond to decitabine and more work is needed to understand that phenomenon responses to decitabine are usually shortlived however with remissions typically lasting for about a year decitabine does not completely clear all the leukemia cells that carry tp53 mutations and these cells invariably become resistant to the drug leading to relapse remissions with decitabine typically dont last long and no one was cured with this drug ley explained but patients who responded to decitabine live longer than what you would expect with aggressive chemotherapy and that can mean something some people live a year or two and with a good quality of life because the chemotherapy is not too toxic roughly 10 percent of aml patients carry tp53 mutations in their leukemia cells among patients in the study with such mutations median survival was 127 months which is not significantly different from the 154 months survival seen in patients without the mutations and is longer than the typical four to sixmonth survival observed in such patients treated with more aggressive therapies decitabine was approved by the fda in 2006 as a treatment for mds but oncologists often prescribe it offlabel as a treatment for aml particularly in older patients aml typically strikes in a persons mid60s the average age of people in the current study was 74 were now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in aml patients of all ages who carry tp53 mutations welch said its exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the

real,for immediate release newswise johns hopkins medicine specialists report they have developed a urine test for the likely emergence of cervical cancer that is highly accurate compared to other tests based on genetic markers derived directly from cervical tissue the new urine test they say is different because it analyzes not only multiple sources of human cellular dna altered by precancerous changes but also dna from hpv that is sexually transmitted and causes virtually all cases of the disease in a proofofconcept study described online in cancer prevention research on november 8 the investigators say their genetic markers test showed a sensitivity or accuracy rate of 909 percent in identifying socalled cin2 lesions cervical lesions with abnormal cells likely to not only develop into cancer but also to develop into cancers likely to spread additionally they demonstrated that the dna for all three human genes and one viral gene could be successfully extracted from urine and they could identify such lesions with 75 percent sensitivity two commercial tests based on markers of dna chemical changes called methylation released in europe last summer require pap smears or swabs of cervical tissue and show 64 percent sensitivity in identifying similar lesions according to senior investigator rafael guerreropreston drph mph assistant professor of otolaryngologyhead and neck surgery at the johns hopkins university school of medicine and member of the johns hopkins kimmel cancer center if further studies confirm these findings we see a significant use of urine screening as a way to quickly and inexpensively determine if a biopsy is warranted or if physicians can use a watch and wait approach before intervening says guerreropreston typically he says a woman who tests positive for hpv and has an abnormal pap smear undergoes a biopsy to rule out cervical cancer using cells taken directly from cervical tissue but previous studies suggest more than 50 percent of these biopsies are unnecessary and can result in pain worry infertility and higher health care costs our urine test would serve as a molecular triage he says at times supplementing pap test information in developing countries that dont have the money medical infrastructure or cultural approval for pap test our test could be used instead the new study builds on the johns hopkins teams previously published work in which investigators identified three genes associated with cervical cancer or abnormallooking cells known to become cancerous fkbp6 ints1 and znf516 as abnormalities progress these genes were more likely to have a chemical methyl group attached to their dna in certain spots the researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing pap smears at hospital dr hernan henriquez aravena in chile the women ranged in age from 18 to 86 among the test samples 34 showed no abnormalities in their cervix 87 showed one of three types of precancerous abnormal tissue and 90 showed clear evidence of cervical cancer next guerreroprestons team isolated dna from each cervical tissue sample and used advanced genetic sequencing methods to spell out the dna makeup of cells in the cervical tissue samples the researchers then compared the number of methyl groups attached to each gene in samples from the 34 healthy women to 53 samples with a specific subset of precancerous markers using methylation as a value to diagnose malignancy the three genes together showed a 90 percent sensitivity meaning that their presence was able to predict a true positive cancer sample this percentage of the time the test had an 889 percent specificity meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease to further improve the accuracy of the test the investigators added a new gene marker to the test this time rather than using a human gene they used one from the virus hpv16l1 which also becomes methylated in human cells as cancer develops they did the test again with the fourgene combination on a new population of women from the university of puerto rico the 115 women ranged in age from 21 to 49 41 participants had healthy cervical tissue and 74 had one of three types of precancerous cells using all four genes the test now had a sensitivity of 909 percent and a specificity of 609 percent when developing a new cancer screening test we want something in the range of 90 to 95 percent sensitivity which is competitive with the effectiveness of tests developed and now marketed in europe says guerreropreston the next step the researchers report was to verify that the fourgene test worked using freely circulating dna from blood and urine rather than dna taken directly from cervical tissue for this experiment they tested 40 samples of paired cervical tissue blood and urine from a subset of the patients from puerto rico using the dna from blood they found the test had an 857 percent sensitivity and a 609 percent specificity using urine they found a 75 percent sensitivity and an 833 percent specificity during the course of the study the time to process cervical samples blood or urine and get a test result took four days they plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples according to world cancer research fund international 84 percent of cervical cancers occur in less developed countries with the highest rates in africa latin american and the caribbean in the united states cervical cancer used to be the highest cause of cancer deaths among women but that soon changed when the yearly pap smear was introduced over 40 years ago countries without the infrastructure or cultural acceptance for regular pap tests have not seen declining cancer rates guerreropreston and his colleagues have a research agreement with cepheid to develop a way to reduce the waiting time for a test result from a maximum of four days in the lab to under three hours in a cepheid instrument using sealed cartridges to minimize sample handling and contamination additional authors on the study include blanca valle anne jedlicka nitesh turaga oluwasina folawiyo francesca pirini fahcina lawson angelo vergura maartje noorhuis amanda dziedzic gabriela perez marisa renehan carolina

real,aurora colo nov 16 2016 researchers at the university of colorado anschutz medical campus have found that high doses of vitamin d reduce the incidence of acute respiratory illness ari in older longterm care residents the findings of the clinical trial published today in the journal of the american geriatrics society could help reduce one of the leading causes of serious illness debilitation and death among patients in nursing homes and other longterm care facilities after studying these patients for a year we found a 40 percent reduction in acute respiratory illness among those who took higher doses of vitamin d said the studys lead author adit ginde md mph professor of emergency medicine at the university of colorado school of medicine vitamin d can improve the immune systems ability to fight infections because it bolsters the first line of defense of the immune system ginde said in older people that first line of defense is often impaired but vitamin d can reinforce it and prevent illnesses like pneumonia influenza and bronchitis it may also prevent infections and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd like emphysema at the same time ginde found that those who received higher doses of vitamin d also saw an increase in falls the falls were lower in those given smaller doses rather than higher monthly doses of vitamin d the clinical trial the first to examine vitamin ds impact on respiratory infections in nursing home residents looked at 107 patients with an average age of 84 over a 12 month period of those 55 received high doses of vitamin d or 100000 units monthly averaging 33004300 units daily and 52 received lower doses averaging between 4001000 units daily those with higher doses saw aris cut nearly in half they also had over double the incidence of falls the study said this finding requires a confirmatory trial including whether high daily doses of vitamin d rather than high monthly doses makes patients less likely to fall ginde said but ginde said the primary finding that vitamin d can reduce ari is a major step forward in treating these dangerous infections this is a potentially lifesaving discovery ginde said there is very little in a doctors arsenal to battle ari especially since most are viral infections where antibiotics dont work but vitamin d seems able to potentially prevent these infections he cautioned that the study is not definitive proof that vitamin d can prevent ari but it suggests that it can and at little risk to the patient if our results are confirmed by a larger trial high dose vitamin d ideally using daily dosing to minimize fall risk has the potential for substantial public health benefit through ari prevention for the large and growing population of long term care residents ginde said

real,the article reports that the device provides clear visualization of the surgical site where the tumor was removed thereby improving communication between the surgeon and radiation oncologist the study also noted that the device provides a helpful guide for posttreatment mammograms and other longterm followup to check for any cancer recurrence in these patients a second study presented at the american society for radiation oncology astro 2016 annual conference describes the extra utility that biozorb can provide by significantly reducing the amount of normal breast and surrounding tissues that are exposed to radiation treatment the world journal of surgery article by lead author breast surgeon michael j cross concluded that the 3d marker is an effective method for delineating the tumor bed with a significant utility for rt radiation therapy planning in the course of this threeyear study dr cross and colleagues also documented a favorable shift toward use of hypofractionated radiation treatment a shorter form of radiation associated with a substantial reduction in treatment costs through our experience with this marker weve observed that its use results in less radiation dose to the patient compared to whole breast radiation plus a better overall cosmetic outcome said dr cross a nationally known breast surgeon at breast treatment associates in fayetteville ark we were also pleased to note in our research that there were no devicerelated complications in this group of patients and that none of them had a recurrence of cancer the biozorb device is placed during lumpectomy surgery which removes the cancer and preserves the breast it is the first and only device that identifies in a reliable way the 3d region where the tumor was removed it is particularly effective because by suturing the implant to the tumor bed the surgeon can more precisely indicate to the radiation oncologist where the cancer was located dr cross notes that because of the markers unique configuration it can also assist with reconstructing the surgical region during the healing process the implantable marker consists of a framework made of a bioabsorbable material that holds six titanium clips the framework slowly dissolves in the body over the course of a year or more the tiny marker clips stay in place so the surgical site can be viewed for longterm monitoring such as mammograms as part of the research for the world journal of surgery study 108 patients with earlystage breast cancer were prospectively implanted with the marker during reconstructive lumpectomy a method of oncoplastic surgery to remove the cancer while reconstructing the remaining breast to improve cosmetic outcomes the average age of women in the study was 63 years the authors concluded that the marker was helpful for several different types of physicians involved in the care of women with breast cancer surgeons radiation oncologists who plan and oversee radiation treatment and radiologists who follow women after breast cancer treatment the article also noted that there was a shift during the threeyear course of the study toward increasing use of hypofractionated radiation methods these methods decrease the time it takes for patients to complete radiation treatment and are estimated to cut the cost of treatment by approximately 25 the authors said use of the marker facilitated their shift toward these shorter courses of radiotherapy use of the marker allowed physicians to be more confident in their targeting and rely less on ambiguous planning targets such as the seroma and surrounding tissue changes seroma is a collection of fluid that builds up in the area of tissue injury after surgery while seromas have customarily been targeted for radiation treatment they do not always reflect where the cancer was and can overestimate the size of the target areas in need of radiation by more precisely marking the tumor bed the article said biozorb can reduce the amount of healthy tissue that would otherwise receive unnecessary radiation the second recent study presented at the 2016 annual astro conference in boston described a collaborative approach between a radiation oncologist and breast surgeon they studied the question of whether the marker could better identify the true lumpectomy cavity and thereby reduce the amount of tissue that is irradiated the authors radiation oncologist william hall md and breast surgeon cary kaufman md combined their analysis of 10 cases in which biozorb was used they concluded that the tissue marker could significantly reduce radiation of healthy breast tissue an average of 65 reduction as well as avoid irradiating inadvertent seromas that are more common with oncoplastic procedures by providing better targeting they said the marker could also play a role in facilitating the use of external beam partial breast irradiation the process of delivering radiation treatment is substantially streamlined by having the 3d marker in place said dr hall the marker tells us where the tumor was and helps us determine appropriate forms of treatment whether with partial breast irradiation or standard whole breast irradiation and a boost dose at the end of the treatment process dr hall is a radiation oncologist in the department of radiation oncology at peacehealth st joseph medical center bellingham wash dr

real,data published by alzheon in the journal of the prevention of alzheimers disease is the first report to associate efficacy of an amyloidtargeted drug with the number of apoe4 alleles framingham mass october 24 2016 results published today in the journal of the prevention of alzheimers disease jpad describe analyses of phase 3 data for the investigational amyloidtargeted drug tramiprosate in patients with mild to moderate alzheimers disease ad these efficacy analyses evaluated patient subgroups based on the number of 4 alleles of apolipoprotein e apoe4 a major genetic risk factor in up to 65 percent of patients with ad 12 the published results showed a genedose effect at the high dose of tramiprosate 150 mg twice daily with patients with two apoe4 alleles apoe44 homozygotes showing the largest clinical benefit those with one apoe4 allele apoe4 heterozygotes showing an intermediate benefit while apoe4 noncarriers showed no benefit from tramiprosate the results published in jpad are the first evidence from a large clinical trial to associate efficacy of an amyloidtargeted agent with apoe4 status in ad patients the manuscript titled clinical benefits of tramiprosate in alzheimers disease are associated with higher number of apoe4 alleles the apoe4 genedose effect is featured in the advanced online publication of the journal of the prevention of alzheimers disease jpad 3 with lead authors from alzheon inc a biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders based on the analyses in the publication alzheon is developing alz801 an optimized oral prodrug of tramiprosate and has refined the design of the pivotal clinical trial to evaluate alz801 as a potential diseasemodifying agent in symptomatic ad patients who are apoe44 homozygotes anton p porsteinsson md professor of psychiatry at the university of rochester school of medicine and dentistry and director of the alzheimers disease care research and education program at the university of rochester in rochester ny and an investigator in the north american phase 3 clinical trial commented the geneticallydefined population of apoe4 carriers has an 812 fold increased risk of developing ad and has more rapidly progressive disease usually becoming symptomatic a decade earlier than noncarriers of the apoe4 genotype these analyses with tramiprosate in the apoe4 subgroups are compelling and suggest a meaningful clinical benefit on top of the existing symptomatic ad treatments in alzheimers patients who are in great need of new treatments we can apply these insights about the therapeutic response of apoe4 carriers to refine patient selection and potentially improve the success rate of new alzheimers medicines the efficacy and safety analyses with tramiprosate published in jpad reveal a therapeutic effect in patients who are carriers of apoe4 after segmenting them from the larger nongeneticallydefined study population in the phase 3 clinical program involving more than 2000 ad patients in north america and europe in the overall mild and moderate ad study population with baseline mmse of 1626 and any apoe genotype the north american study did not demonstrate a significant benefit with either of two tramiprosate doses 100 mg bid and 150 mg bid compared to placebo during the 78week study period 4 as a result the european study was terminated before completion and the results were not previously published to our knowledge this is the first time that the clinical benefits of an amyloidtargeted agent have been associated with the number of apoe4 alleles in alzheimers patients this new insight shows how we can apply a precision medicine approach in ad and develop this drug for the right patients namely patients with the apoe4 genotype which carries the highest risk as well as the earliest onset and faster disease progression said martin tolar md phd founder president and ceo of alzheon these newlypublished findings form the basis for the design of our phase 3 program and further support our companys commitment to advance alz801 into pivotal studies in apoe44 homozygous ad patients who represent up to 15 of ad patients1 we are preparing to advance alz801 a promising new treatment for alzheimers disease into confirmatory clinical studies in 2017 the observed genedose effects of tramiprosate in apoe4 carriers are consistent with the prevalence of amyloid pathology in ad patients amyloid imaging in ad clinical trials has shown the highest prevalence of positive amyloid scans in apoe44 homozygotes and the lowest prevalence in apoe4 noncarriers 5 as one of the few orallyadministered amyloidtargeted agents tramiprosate blocks the aggregation of beta amyloid monomers into toxic oligomers and was developed to show efficacy in patients with amyloid pathology and an accurate diagnosis of ad efficacy results in apoe44 homozygous patients from the jpad phase 3 analyses the published results showed the largest clinical benefit in the alzheimers apoe44 homozygous ad patients who represent approximately 15 percent of patients in the study3 apoe44 homozygous patients who received the high dose of tramiprosate showed efficacy benefit compared to placebo on both cognitive and functional measures in the phase 3 analyses the effects on the adascog cognitive outcome were significant at week 65 ls means difference from placebo 347 nominal p 0007 and week 78 260 nominal p 0043 and corresponded to 66 percent and 40 percent benefit from tramiprosate compared to placebo these effects were supported by functional benefits on the cdrsb that showed a positive trend at week 65 ls means difference from placebo 079 nominal p 0063 and were numerically in favor of tramiprosate at week 78 054 nominal p 021 apoe44 homozygous ad patients are especially challenging since they are known to have the highest burden of amyloid pathology in cerebral cortex and blood vessels which explains their susceptibility to ariae with some amyloidtargeted treatments in these new subgroup analyses the high dose of tramiprosate showed promising clinical effects in apoe44 homozygous ad patients already receiving maximal standard of care and this dose was not associated with any events of vasogenic edema said susan abushakra md chief medical officer of alzheon and lead author on the jpad publication replication of these findings in alzheons planned phase 3 study would provide a meaningful therapeutic advance for ad patients with the apoe44 genotype and we are now preparing to carry forward these results into the development of alz801 safety results from the jpad phase 3 analyses the safety profile of tramiprosate in 2025 ad patients across the two studies was favorable and similar in the apoe4 carriers and noncarriers the main adverse events were gastrointestinal nausea vomiting and weight loss which were mild or moderate in severity new ariae safety analyses were reported in the jpad publication brain magnetic resonance imaging mri evaluations in 426 patients were conducted during the phase 3 studies and did not reveal any events of vasogenic brain edema ariae or amyloidrelated imaging abnormalitiesedema on either dose of tramiprosate vasogenic edema or brain swelling is a side effect observed in clinical studies with some injectable antiamyloid antibodies which requires mri monitoring and can occasionally be serious 6 about tramiprosate and the new prodrug alz801 in 2013 alzheon obtained the license to tramiprosate and the associated portfolio of drug compounds along with the historical clinical dataset and applied new insights to the existing data this led to the development of an optimized oral amyloidtargeted drug candidate alz801 alzheon developed alz801 as a novel oral prodrug of tramiprosate designed to improve the pharmacokinetic and gastrointestinal tolerability profile while retaining tramiprosate as the active agent in alz801 phase 1 studies in more than 170 subjects including healthy elderly showed that alz801 provides consistent plasma levels of tramiprosate with very low intersubject variability the rate of nausea and vomiting was also lower than with tramiprosate tablets alz801 at the dose of 265 mg provided equivalent systemic plasma exposures to tramiprosate 150 mg tablets alzheon is advancing alz801 into pivotal phase 3 studies in the geneticallydefined apoe44 homozygous patients with alzheimers disease about apolipoprotein e apolipoprotein e or apoe is a gene that provides a predictive window into an individuals alzheimers disease prognosis apoe encodes for a protein called apolipoprotein e which combines with fats to form lipoproteins that can be moved throughout the body in the brain apolipoprotein e helps shuttle cholesterol to neurons to support their normal function there are three forms or alleles of the apoe gene called 2 3 and 4 the 4 allele has been found to correlate with high risk of developing alzheimers disease people who inherit one copy of the 4 allele apoe4 heterozygotes have an increased chance of developing the disease those who inherit two copies of the allele apoe4 homozygotes are at even greater risk

real,providence ri brown university to the tantalizing delight of chocolate lovers everywhere a number of recent studies employing various methods have suggested that compounds in cocoa called flavanols could benefit cardiovascular health now a systematic review and metaanalysis of 19 randomized controlled trials rcts of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence the metaanalysis in the journal of nutrition an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 rcts focused on whether consumption of flavanolrich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content in all 1139 volunteers were involved in these trials our metaanalysis of rcts characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers providing guidance in designing large definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work said corresponding author dr simin liu professor and director of the center for global cardiometabolic health at brown university who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author xiaochen lin we found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia elevated triglycerides insulin resistance and systemic inflammation which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases liu noted some limitations in the trials all studies were small and of short duration not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes but taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies the teams metaanalysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanolrich cocoa on cardiometabolic health there were smalltomodest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanolrich cocoa product vs those who did not the greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day based on their cocoa consumption they saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called homair they also saw an increase in hdl or good cholesterol those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides but not a significant increase in hdl those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant hdl benefit in general lin said where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didnt depend on what physical form the flavanolrich cocoa product was consumed in dark chocolate vs a beverage for example the treatment groups of the trials included in our metaanalysis are primarily dark chocolate a few were using cocoa powderbased beverages lin said therefore the findings from the current study apparently shouldnt be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates of which the content of sugarfood additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate the authors therefore concluded our study highlights the urgent need for large longterm rcts that improve our understanding of how the shortterm benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes
real,antiinflammatory drugs similar to those used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis could in future be used to treat some cases of depression concludes a review led by the university of cambridge which further implicates our immune system in mental health disorders researchers from the department of psychiatry at cambridge led a team that analysed data from 20 clinical trials involving the use of anticytokine drugs to treat a range of autoimmune inflammatory diseases by looking at additional beneficial sideeffects of the treatments the researchers were able to show that there was a significant antidepressant effect from the drugs compared to a placebo based on a metaanalysis of seven randomised controlled trials metaanalyses of the other types of clinical trials showed similar results when we are exposed to an infection for example influenza or a stomach bug our immune system fights back to control and remove the infection during this process immune cells flood the blood stream with proteins known as cytokines this process is known as systemic inflammation even when we are healthy our bodies carry trace levels of these proteins known as inflammatory markers which rise exponentially in response to infection previous work from the team found that children with high everyday levels of one of these markers are at greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood suggesting a role for the immune system particularly chronic lowgrade systemic inflammation in mental illness inflammation can also occur as a result of the immune system mistaking healthy cells for infected cells and attacking the body leading to autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and crohns disease new types of antiinflammatory drugs called anticytokine monoclonal antibodies and cytokine inhibitors have been developed recently some of which are now routinely used for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatments many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety the team of researchers carried out a metaanalysis of these clinical trials and found that the drugs led to an improvement in the severity of depressive symptoms independently of improvements in physical illness in other words regardless of whether a drug successfully treated rheumatoid arthritis for example it would still help improve a patients depressive symptoms their results are published today in the journal molecular psychiatry dr golam khandaker who led the study says its becoming increasingly clear to us that inflammation plays a role in depression at least for some individuals and now our review suggests that it may be possible to treat these individuals using some antiinflammatory drugs these are not your everyday antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen however but a particular new class of drugs its too early to say whether these anticytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression however adds professor peter jones coauthor of the study we will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed such as rheumatoid arthritis or crohns disease on top of this some existing drugs can have potentially serious side effects which would need to be addressed dr khandaker and colleagues believe that antiinflammatory drugs may offer hope for patients for whom current antidepressants are ineffective although the trials reviewed by the team involve physical illnesses that trigger inflammation and hence potentially contribute to depression their previous work found a connection between depression and baseline levels of inflammation in healthy people when someone does not have an acute infection which can be caused by a number of factors such as genes and psychological stress about a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation adds dr khandaker so antiinflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression the current approach of a onesizefitsall medicine to treat depression is problematic all currently available antidepressants target a particular type of neurotransmitter but a third of patients do not respond to these drugs we are now entering the era of personalised medicine where we can tailor treatments to individual patients this approach is starting to show success in treating cancers and its possible that in future we would use antiinflammatory drugs in psychiatry for certain patients with depression

real,newswise columbus oh good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that wont heal a team of researchers at the ohio state university has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection nearly 7 million americans have chronic wounds typically a result of diabetes obesity or other conditions that impact circulation costing the healthcare system nearly 25 billion each year the nonhealing wounds are painful can permanently damage nerves prevent mobility and in extreme cases cause infection that can lead to death the patchs design significantly advances existing fdaapproved wireless electroceutical dressing wed that harnesses the bodys innate response to injury to help wounds heal a wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration however this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds said sashwati roy phd an associate professor in the department of surgery at ohio states college of medicine the prototype dressing mimics this physiological process and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control roy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria which at times are free floating within a wound can sometimes mobilize creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm the immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm and antibiotics cant get in either causing constant inflammation and lowlevel infection that can further dampen the healing process now with support from ohio states center for clinical and translational science ccts researchers from both the college of engineering and the college of medicine are taking the technology to the next level working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by shaurya prakash phd and vish subramaniam phd the scientists have optimized the bandages design and the amount of electrical current delivered like present weds the new prototype is flexible portable and selfcontained made of silk and silver the experimental dressing includes a selfcontained battery that delivers a continuous safe lowlevel electrical current to the injury were hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding said subramaniam chair of the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering at ohio state the destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria reduce chronic inflammation and allow the bodys natural immune response to work more effectively bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics but to our knowledge bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals to test the experimental design roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome obesity high blood pressure high blood sugar which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds animal models had skin injuries infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus or acinetobacter baumannii three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant early results which were presented at the wound healing societys annual meeting in april 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the bodys natural immune response the teams next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population however the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries roy also notes that the u s department of defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front this technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit it could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care the team already has interest from several industry partners and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level roys research team includes shomita s steiner phd shaurya prakash phd

toxicity and excellent cancer control rates according to research presented today at the 58th annual meeting of the american society for radiation oncology astro the study is the first large multiinstitutional study of sbrt in prostate cancer with longterm followup although prostate tumors generally respond well to radiation therapy rt the possibility of radiation exposure to healthy tissue in the genitourinary gu and gastrointestinal gi systems can be of concern sbrt is an advanced technique that precisely targets high doses of rt to the tumor in a small number fractions simultaneously avoiding surrounding tissue and reducing toxicity to noncancerous cells the technique has become the standard of care for many nonsurgical lung cancer patients as it limits exposure to the heart and surrounding lungs when treating tumors in the prostate sbrt avoids the adjacent bladder sex organs and rectum singleinstitution studies on the use of sbrt as the primary treatment for prostate cancer have illuminated the treatment as a costeffective and faster alternative to imrt said robert meier md lead author of the study and a radiation oncologist at swedish medical center in seattle our study is the first to contribute multicenter data that support the use of sbrt as frontline therapy for men with prostate cancer a total of 309 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were enrolled in the trial at 21 community regional and academic hospitals across the us eligible patients had either lowrisk disease cs t1t2a gleason 6 psa < 10 n 172 or intermediaterisk disease cs t1ct2b with either gleason 7 and psa < 10 or gleason 6 and psa 1020 all of the men received sbrt via a nonisocentric robotic platform with an rt dose to the prostate of 40 gy administered in five treatment sessions of 8 gy each intermediate risk patients received a dose of 3625 gy to the seminal vesicles concurrent and adjuvant androgen ablation therapy were prohibited among study participants primary outcomes included gu and gi toxicities and relapsefree survival rfs researchers measured toxicity using the national cancer institutes common terminology criteria for adverse events ctcae

five years following sbrt five grade three gu side effects were reported in four of the 309 study participants there were no reported grade four or five toxicities nor any grade three gi toxicities between half and twothirds of patients experienced less serious side effects with rates of 53 and 59 percent for grade one gu and gi toxicities and rates of 35 and 10 percent for grade two gu and gi toxicities respectively these side effects were usually temporary our results illustrate how advanced technology has radically improved our ability to target cancer said dr meier after following patients for more than five years we found that serious side effects from a brief course of sbrt were uncommon and that cancer control rates were very favorable compared to historical data our trial confirms that sbrt may be preferable to other treatment approaches for newlydiagnosed cases of prostate cancer including more aggressive disease the abstract fiveyear outcomes from a multicenter trial

prescription medicine used for a short period of time a few weeks for weight reduction in adults with an initial body mass index bmi of 30 or more obese or 27 or more overweight with at least one weightrelated condition such as controlled high blood pressure diabetes or high cholesterol lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reducedcalorie diet lomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals the limited usefulness of agents of this drug class anorectics including lomaira should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use at kvk tech we are committed to developing highquality fdaapproved medicines that address unmet medical needs while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients with lomaira were giving physicians and patients access to a lowcost lowdose version of a weightreduction medicine phentermine that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years appropriate patients can take lomaira up to three times a day before meals not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine said anthony tabasso president and chief executive officer of kvk tech we developed lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind phentermine hydrochloride an appetite suppressant is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals hcps including obesity medicine specialists family practitioners endocrinologists internists and cardiologists 1 phentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 375 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast the usual adult dose of lomaira is one tablet three times a day 12 hour before meals the butterflyshaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weightloss treatment plan to best meet each patients needs dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia lomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle despite the fact that twothirds of americans pay outofpocket for their weightloss prescription medications through kvk techs lomaira locost access program eligible patients will pay no more than 50 per tablet for the duration of treatment obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weightmanagement plan now the flexibility in dosing with lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing they can prescribe a lower dose a good option for some patients they can also prescribe up to three times a day which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon said donna ryan md regrettably many patients are still not covered by insurance for weightloss medications and the low cost for lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option in relatively shortterm clinical trials adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with anorectic drugs appetite suppressants lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet it has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions or metabolic effects may also be involved 2 even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health continued dr ryan it is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits such as improvements in blood pressure blood cholesterol and blood sugars3 some side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension valvular heart disease palpitations increased heart rate or blood pressure insomnia restlessness dry mouth diarrhea constipation and changes in sexual drive

real,london sept 14 2016 prnewswire gsk lsenyse gsk today announced the publication of detailed results from a randomised phase iii study zoe70 of its investigational shingles vaccine shingrix showing 90 efficacy in adults aged 70 years and older that is maintained for at least four years1 the results were published in the new england journal of medicine nejm the study from which headline results were reported in october 2015 showed that the twodose candidate shingles vaccine had 90 efficacy 95 confidence interval 8494 compared to placebo in people over 70 years old vaccine efficacy was maintained across the various age groups included in the study ranging between 90 in people aged 7079 years 95 confidence interval 8394 and 89 in those aged 80 years and above1 95 confidence interval 74961 the high efficacy is in line with the results of the zoe50 trial a study in people over 50 years old which was presented and published last year showing a 97 efficacy 95 confidence interval 93992 a pooled analysis of data from both trials showed the vaccine demonstrated 91 efficacy against shingles 95 confidence interval 8695 in adults aged 70 years and older compared to placebo1 this efficacy was maintained with an 88 reduction in the risk of shingles 95 confidence interval 7395 in the fourth year after vaccination the risk of serious adverse events potential immunemediated diseases or deaths observed in zoe70 was similar in people receiving shingrix and placebo the most commonly reported local adverse reaction was pain at the injection site and the most frequently reported systemic adverse reaction was fatigue the majority of injection site and systemic reactions occurred within seven days of vaccination with most lasting 13 days and generally were mildtomoderate in intensity1 in addition a pooled analysis of data from the zoe70 and zoe50 trials showed that the candidate vaccine effectively reduced the risk of subsequent chronic neuropathic pain also known as postherpetic neuralgia phn1 which is the most common and often severe complication of shingles34 the candidate vaccine was shown to be 89 95 confidence interval 6897 efficacious in preventing phn in people aged 70 years and older and 91 efficacious 95 confidence interval 7598 in people aged 50 years and over1 dr emmanuel hanon senior vice president vaccines research and development gsk said this is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people and it is remarkable as we know that these people frequently have an agerelated weakening of their immune system if approved this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people anthony cunningham executive director of the westmead institute for medical research in australia and principal investigator of the zoe70 study said these data show that this investigational vaccine maintains high efficacy against herpes zoster in people over 70 and 80 years of age the age groups who are most affected by the disease importantly it also prevents a common and feared complication of herpes zoster prolonged pain or post herpetic neuralgia in these groups based on these and the previously reported zoe50 data2 gsk expects to start submitting regulatory applications for the candidate vaccine for the prevention of shingles in people 50 years and above later this year about shingrix shingrix is a nonlive adjuvanted subunit hzsu candidate vaccine to help prevent herpes zoster and its complications the candidate vaccine combines glycoprotein e a protein found on the varicella zoster virus vzv that causes shingles with an adjuvant system as01 b which is intended to enhance the immunological response to the antigen5 additional trials to evaluate the ability of shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems these studies will provide additional information with respect to the efficacy and safety profile of the candidate vaccine as well as its ability to stimulate immune responses in other populations and in specific circumstances notes to editors the name shingrix is not yet approved for use by regulatory

about shingles shingles typically presents as a painful itchy rash that develops on one side of the body as a result of reactivation of latent chickenpox virus varicella zoster virus vzv anyone who has been infected with vzv is at risk of developing shingles with age and altered immune system being recognised as the main risk factors34 complications from shingles can include phn the most common complication scarring vision complications secondary infection and nerve palsies34phn is often defined as a localized pain of significant intensity persisting at least 90 days after the appearance of the acute shingles rash4 data from many countries indicate that older adults aged 50 and over are at highest risk for shingles as more than 90 of older adults have been infected with wild type vzv3 a persons risk for shingles increases sharply after 50 years of age3 risk of complications including phn and hospitalisation also increase with age3 the individual lifetime risk of developing shingles

real,measuring blood levels of the recently discovered hormone irisin may improve diagnosis rates of teenagers with polycystic ovary syndrome according to research presented today at the 55th annual european society for paediatric endocrinology meeting measuring blood levels of the recently discovered hormone irisin may improve diagnosis rates of teenagers with polycystic ovary syndrome according to research presented today at the 55th annual european society for paediatric endocrinology meeting the findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls polycystic ovary syndrome pcos is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12 of women women with pcos are more likely to suffer from irregular periods have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries doctors are cautious when diagnosing pcos in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives the cause of pcos is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition previous studies have associated high levels of irisin a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism with pcos in adults in this study greek researchers from aghia sophia childrens hospital in athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with pcos with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and bmi they found that teenagers with pcos had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone a key marker of pcos the findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for pcos allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily teenagers who get an early diagnosis of pcos can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition said lead researcher dr flora bacopoulou whether its through counselling or medication girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems hirsutism excessive hair growth and type2 diabetes the group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in pcos if high irisin levels in teenagers with pcos is established this could lead to the development of treatments for pcos lifestyle changes and different exerciserelated signals that regulate the secretion of irisin could provide a potential option for the management of pcos the potential of irisin as a meaningful drug target in pcos is very promising said dr bacopoulou
real,newswise durham nc patients suffering from noninfectious uveitis a group of diseases that causes eye inflammation can get effective treatment from a corticosteroid alternative that has previously been approved for treatment of arthritis and crohns disease according to a study led by a duke health researcher the food drug administration recently approved the additional use of adalimumab sold as humira for patients with noninfectious uveitis corticosteroids have traditionally been the only fdaapproved treatment for these diseases although some doctors had prescribed adalimumab offlabel the fdas approval is limited to treatment of the three types of noninfectious uveitis that pose the greatest threat of vision loss glenn jaffe md a professor in the department of ophthalmology at duke university school of medicine said adalimumab works to treat uveitis by targeting a protein that is thought to promote inflammation jaffe led one of two clinical studies that formed the basis of the fdas approval and was senior author of the study appearing sept 8 in the new england journal of medicine nejm patients may have many unwanted side effects when taking steroids longterm as many uveitis patients do jaffe said the goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids the studies also looked at whether an alternative would be better tolerated or more effective yet still safe the study consisted of 217 adults who had active noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis or panuveitis participants were randomly assigned to a group that received either adalimumab or a placebo at the start of the trial and every two weeks thereafter all participants also initially received standard doses of the corticosteroid prednisone and continued to receive it in diminishing doses over the course of 15 weeks jaffe and colleagues then analyzed patients time to treatment failure or how soon they saw a recurrence or worsening of one or more of four signs of inflammation new areas of inflammation in the back of the eye reduced visual clarity more inflammatory cells in the front of the eye or more cloudiness of the gel that fills the eye jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment it is the active inflammation caused by the bodys immune system reacting against itself that can potentially permanently decrease the patients vision and cause unwanted symptoms such as eye pain and floaters in the field of vision he said the hope is that by delaying or eliminating recurrences the symptoms will be minimized or eliminated the researchers found that median time to treatment failure was 24 weeks in the adalimumab group and 13 weeks in the placebo group patients in the adalimumab group were also significantly less likely to experience treatment failure during the duration of the study 80 weeks and they were at lower risk of treatment failure due to each of the four signs jaffe said the studys results are significant not only because they indicate adalimumab delays treatment failure but also because the investigation considered several signs as causes for treatment failure using these multiple possible endpoints was something unique to this study jaffe said since each of these signs can be associated with different types of uveitis the studys results broaden the applicability of treatment for patients the study authors note however that patients in the adalimumab group reported serious adverse effects such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions more frequently than those in the placebo group in addition to jaffe coauthors include andrew d dick antoine p brzin quan dong nguyen jennifer e thorne philippe kestelyn talin barisaniasenbauer pablo franco arnd heiligenhaus david scales david s chu anne camez nisha v kwatra alexandra p song martina kron samir tari and eric b suhler abbvie the pharmaceutical company that manufactures and markets adalimumab as humira sponsored the study dr jaffe served as a consultant for abbvie and other study authors also report financial relationships with the company further author disclosures are available in the studys manuscript humira provides effective nonsteroid alternative for eye inflammation
real,dallas september 05 2016 a new class of drugs called hif2 inhibitors is more effective and better tolerated than the standard of care drug sunitinib in treating kidney cancer researchers with the kidney cancer program at harold c simmons comprehensive cancer center have found hif2 inhibitors which grew out of research begun more than 20 years ago at ut southwestern medical center work by interfering with processes that fuel the growth of cells investigators conducted a preclinical trial in mice transplanted with kidney cancer from over 20 patients and showed that the hif2 inhibitor pt2399 controlled cancer in half of the tumors according to a study published in the journal nature this is a completely new treatment for kidney cancer we want to make hif2 inhibitors available to patients and are currently carrying out clinical trials said dr james brugarolas director of the kidney cancer program who is leading an 11 million spore grant from the national cancer institute seeking to translate new discoveries into novel therapies for kidney cancer patients part of the spore grant one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation is focused on further researching hif2 inhibitors in a previous report dr kevin courtney assistant professor of internal medicine and a coauthor of the current study reported at the american association of clinical oncology annual meeting that hif2 inhibitors were safe in patients and had activity even in heavily pretreated patients in the study in nature investigators show that hif2 inhibition was able to control metastatic kidney cancer even after 7 lines of prior therapy see video the findings show that hif2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer said dr brugarolas senior author and a virginia murchison linthicum scholar in medical research at ut southwestern nearly 400000 americans are now living with a diagnosis of kidney cancer and more than 60000 people are expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year according to the national cancer institute texas has the fifth highest rate of this cancer in the us what is hif2 hifs or hypoxiainducible factors like hif2 allow the bodys cells to adjust to lowoxygen environments hifs activate programs that promote the development of blood vessels facilitate oxygen delivery and promote efficient nutrient utilization kidney cancer cells hijack the same system to fuel their growth hif2 inhibitors work by suppressing the effects of hif2 which include downregulating an important protein called vegf that promotes the formation of blood vessels needed for tumors to grow unlike existing vegf inhibitors the hif2 inhibitor blocks vegf only in the cancer and therefore does not cause cardiac toxicity or hypertension dr brugarolas explained new hif2 findings in the nature study researchers compared the two drugs head to head and found that the hif2 inhibitor was more active than sunitinib and that it was active against tumors

on the study he said researchers surprisingly found a subset of tumors that do not respond to the drug but were able to identify biomarkers that once verified would help determine which patients are more likely to benefit from hif2 therapies hif2 is believed to be the most important driver of kidney cancer traditionally proteins like hif2 were disregarded as drug targets because their shape made it nearly impossible to design drugs against them dr brugarolas said the approaches we have taken pave the way for identifying drug candidates for other proteins that have traditionally been

real,newswise charlottesville va aug 25 2016 a study published today in the prestigious new england journal of medicine offers the most indepth assessment yet of the safety and effectiveness of a hightech alternative to brain surgery to treat the uncontrollable shaking caused by the most common movement disorder and the news is very good the paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial led by jeff elias md of the university of virginia health system that evaluated the scalpelfree approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor et a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million americans not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective they found that it offered a lasting benefit reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12month study period this study represents a major advance for neurosurgery treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of et elias said for the first time in a randomized controlled trial we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease pioneering tremor trialthe multisite clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor a condition that often robs people of their ability to write feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities the trial participants all had tried existing medications without success the mean age was 71 and most had suffered with their tremor for many years seventyfive percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging the remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure to act as the control group they would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure participants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period the researchers employed a 32point scale to assess tremor severity and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months participants reported major improvements in their quality of life people who couldnt feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so participants who received the sham procedure on the other hand showed no significant improvements the degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life thats what patients really care about elias said the most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face in most instances these side effects were temporary but some were permanent fda approved based on the clinical trial led by elias the federal food and drug administration has approved the focused ultrasound device manufactured by insightec inc for the treatment of essential tremor the device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat much like a magnifying glass focuses light that heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor elias can actually watch as patients tremor decreases and the realtime imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain the fda approval means uva can make the procedure available to eligible patients uva however is still working out the necessary logistics its not yet clear when elias will begin treating patients because the approach is so new insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure though that may change in the coming months the cost at uva has not yet been determined people interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealthcomfocusedultrasound the site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as uva prepares to make the treatment available the procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor it cant be used in patients who cannot undergo mri imaging including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker it is also not available for pregnant women people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders patients on blood thinners patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues there are other exclusions as well doctors at uva will evaluate potential patients to determine their eligibility and then recommend the best course of treatment groundbreaking

real,the majority of smokers who successfully switch to vaping say they have fewer respiratory infections according to a study led by queen mary university of london the majority of smokers who successfully switch to vaping say they have fewer respiratory infections according to a study led by queen mary university of london qmul the online survey of 941 respondents assessed subjective changes in respiratory symptoms in smokers who switched to vaping for at least two months the results published in the journal of addiction research therapy show that 66 per cent of respondents reported an improvement in respiratory symptoms 29 per cent reported no change and 5 per cent reported worsening senior author professor peter hajek from qmul said there is no doubt that ecigarettes are much safer than conventional cigarettes but smokers are still led to believe that theyre dangerous this misinformation includes a misreported study on rats that claimed that vaping may increase vulnerability to infections these new findings from human vapers show that this is not the case the study needs to be interpreted with caution because it is based on selfreported data and further studies using objective measures are needed however the present results provide sufficient information to suggest that vaping does not increase infection rates and may in fact lead to a decrease in infections some previous cell and animal studies have been interpreted as suggesting that vaping may increase vulnerability to infection but these studies did not use realistic exposure levels human trials have reported no significant adverse respiratory effects associated with ecigarette use for up to 15 years and a followup study of smokers with asthma who switched to vaping found significant improvements the researchers say that it is not surprising that the survey respondents noticed improvements in their respiratory health this is because smoking increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and stopping smoking can be expected to have a positive effect in addition to this vaping may also provide some antimicrobial protection through the eliquid ingredient propylene glycol though further evidence is needed to confirm this the main limitation of the study is that the reports are subjective future studies should assess respiratory symptoms objectively and on unselected samples of vapers despite the limitations the researchers say that the study provides a reasonable reassurance that vaping does not promote respiratory infections and may in fact reduce them
real,an improved therapy to replace essential steroids in the body is a step closer thanks to new research the new treatment expected to have fewer side effects than existing therapies could help people with disorders of the adrenal gland whose bodies are unable to produce a class of steroids called corticosteroids corticosteroids are involved in a wide range of physiological processes in the body including regulating metabolism blood pressure and helping the body to cope with physical stress the therapy could help people with conditions such as addisons disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia who need steroid treatment to avoid the risk of potentially fatal illness during physical stress treatment usually involves replacing one of the steroids they are unable to produce called cortisol with a medication however this approach also affects fat tissue and can lead to excessive weight gain high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes researchers at the university of edinburghs british heart foundation centre for cardiovascular science studied another steroid called corticosterone which is also naturally produced by the body until now there has been little research into its activity in a mouse study the team showed that the effects of corticosterone on fat cells were reduced compared with cortisol they found the effects were reduced because fat cells have a pump that removes corticosterone but not cortisol from the fat cells the researchers tested the therapy in a small group of patients with addisons disease the team found that corticosterone was as effective as cortisol but had reduced effects on fat cells compared with cortisol professor brian walker head of the bhf centre for cardiovascular science at the university of edinburgh said these findings suggest that corticosterone could provide a safer alternative to traditional cortisol replacement therapy for conditions such as addisons disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia the researchers say that with further research these findings may oneday lead to improved therapies for other conditions that respond to steroid treatment including asthma and rheumatoid arthritis dr mark nixon of the bhf centre for cardiovascular science at the university of edinburgh said the discovery of this selective corticosterone pump in fat cells could lead to a completely new approach in our search for safer steroid medications the study published in the journal science translational medicine was funded by wellcome the british heart foundation the medical research council and the engineering and physical sciences research council
real,philadelphia patients with aggressive subtypes of locallyadvanced breast cancer may have new treatment options on the horizon according to two reports published in july in the new england journal of medicine results of two different investigational arms of a multidrug phase ii trial conducted in part by researchers at the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania and the abramson cancer center show that use of new targeted therapies neratinib or a combination of veliparib and carboplatin improves outcomes when used in addition to standard chemotherapy before surgery for patients with her2positive and triplenegative breast cancer respectively the results are part of the multiinstitutional ispy 2 study compared to standard therapies alone the drugs tested in the trial substantially reduced the presence of residual disease in the breast tissue and lymph nodes known as achieving pathological complete response or pcr when administered before surgery said angela demichele md msce a professor of hematologyoncology and epidemiology at the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania a coinvestigator and chair of trial operations for the study known as ispy 2 pcr strongly predicts prevention of later recurrence of incurable metastatic disease these results suggest that neratinib and veliparibcarboplatin are very promising treatment options for patients with her2positive and triplenegative breast cancer respectively in addition the platform used for the ispy 2 trial allows the research team to test these and other new therapies simultaneously targeting tumor subtypes that would be most likely to benefit from the therapies minimizing the exposure of patients to treatments that are not likely to work for their disease subtype and accelerating drug development the data presented in the two nejm articles shows that when added to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy the combination of the molecularly targeted experimental drug veliparib plus carboplatin showed sufficient improvement to meet the prespecified threshold for graduation from the trial signifying a high likelihood for success in a modest confirmatory phase 3 neoadjuvant trial in the triple negative subset likewise the experimental drug neratinib was found to have sufficient improvement in the pcr rate for patients in the her2positivehrnegative subset that it too was graduated from the ispy 2 trial because there are so many subtypes of breast cancer and because we always test drugs in the metastatic and then adjuvant setting finding effective therapies is a very difficult and long process the ispy 2 platform allows therapies to be tested and evaluated in more expeditious costeffective ways said laura j esserman md mba a professor of surgery and radiology and director of the carol franc buck breast care center at ucsf helen diller family comprehensive cancer center in san francisco principal investigator on the ispy 2 trial and a senior author on the reports these results provide valuable information on which drugs should proceed to confirmatory trials to improve outcomes for patients with extremely aggressive cancers that put women at risk for early recurrence and death for these patients time is of the essence in particular finding drug combinations that are effective and less toxic is extremely important the new studies show that by using the ispy 2 model to match therapies with biomarker subsets we can create trials that are more focused smaller and faster thereby exposing more patients to effective treatments a major achievement in the progression of ispy 2 has been significantly reducing the time it takes to move forward from initiation of discussions with drug companies to enrollment of the first patients ispy 2 has compressed this timeline from an average timeframe of 18 36 months to five months the ispy 2 study startup period takes approximately 4560 days with more than 50 percent of the sites opening and enrolling patients as opposed to the traditional study startup timing of 10 to 13 months with less than 25 percent of the sites opening and enrolling more than 45 investigators from the nations most prestigious and innovative cancer research centers coauthored the two nejm articles with hundreds of staff and investigators involved in ispy 2 overall in addition to dr esserman the principal investigators for ispy 2 is donald a berry phd a professor in the department of biostatistics at the university of texas md anderson cancer center and founder of berry consultants a complete list of the participating centers and investigators is provided in a supplementary appendix available at nejmorg the ispy 2 trial is sponsored by quantumleap healthcare collaborative a nonprofit foundation that was established in 2005 as a collaboration between medical researchers at university of california at san francisco and silicon valley entrepreneurs quantumleaps mission is to accelerate transfer of highimpact research in clinical processes and systems technology into widespread adoption so that patients and physicians can benefit from the research as soon as practicable quantumleap provides

real,researchers have found evidence that a natural fruit extract is capable of dissolving calcium oxalate crystals the most common component of human kidney stones this finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years jeffrey rimer associate professor of chemical engineering at the university of houston was lead author of the study published aug 8 in the online edition of nature the work offers the first evidence that the compound hydroxycitrate hca is an effective inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth that under certain conditions is actually able to dissolve these crystals researchers also explain how it works the findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies computational studies and human studies rimer said kidney stones are small hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys affecting up to 12 percent of men and seven percent of women high blood pressure diabetes and obesity can increase the risk and the reported incidence is on the rise preventive treatment has not changed much over the last three decades doctors tell patients who are at risk of developing stones to drink lots of water and avoid foods rich in oxalate such as rhubarb okra spinach and almonds they often recommend taking citrate ca in the form of potassium citrate a supplement that can slow crystal growth but some people are unable to tolerate the side effects the project grew out of preliminary work done by collaborator john asplin a nephrologist at litholink corporation who suggested hca as a possible treatment hca is chemically similar to ca and is also available as a dietary supplement hca shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones the researchers wrote hca may be preferred as a therapy over ca potassium citrate in addition to rimer and asplin authors on the paper include giannis mpourmpakis and his graduate student michael g taylor of the university of pittsburgh ignacio granja of litholink corporation and jihae chung a uh graduate student working in rimers lab the headtohead studies of ca and hca determined that while both compounds inhibit the growth of calcium oxalate crystals hca was more potent and displayed unique qualities that are advantageous for the development of new therapies the team of researchers then used atomic force microscopy or afm to study interactions between the crystals ca and hca under realistic growth conditions according to rimer the technique allowed them to record crystal growth in real time with nearmolecular resolution chung noted that the afm images recorded the crystal actually shrinking when exposed to specific concentrations of hca rimer suspected the initial finding was an abnormality as it is rare to see a crystal actually dissolve in highly supersaturated growth solutions the most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing it turned out that chungs initial finding was correct once they confirmed it is possible to dissolve crystals in supersaturated solutions researchers then looked at reasons to explain why that happened mpourmpakis and taylor applied density functional theory dft a highly accurate computational method used to study the structure and properties of materials to address how hca and ca bind to calcium and to calcium oxalate crystals they discovered hca formed a stronger bond with crystal surfaces inducing a strain that is seemingly relieved by the release of calcium and oxalate leading to crystal dissolution hca was also tested in human subjects as seven people took the supplement for three days allowing researchers to determine that hca is excreted through urine a requirement for the supplement to work as a treatment while rimer said the research established the groundwork to design an effective drug questions remain longterm safety dosage and additional human trials are needed he said but our initial findings are very promising he said if it works in vivo similar to our trials in the laboratory hca has the potential to reduce the incidence rate of people with chronic kidney stone disease
real,ann arbor mich its a catch22 with potentially deadly consequences people trying to overcome addiction cant get treatment for their pain because the most powerful pain medicines also carry an addiction risk and so their pain continues to get in the way of their addiction recovery or they seek pain relief in the same addictive substances theyre trying to avoid but a new study shows the potential for patients to break out of that cycle through a nondrug approach that combines behavioral therapy and social support to help them manage their pain the lowcost approach grounded in psychological theories of pain could help address the nations epidemic of addictions to opioid painkillers and illicit drugs veterans who received this painfocused care while also being treated for addiction found that the intensity of their pain decreased their ability to function increased and their alcohol use went down compared to veterans who received a lessfocused approach however the two groups had similar rates of drug use just 10 weekly sessions of the approach called impat for improving pain during addiction treatment had an effect that lasted up to a year in 55 veterans who took part according to the new results published in the journal addiction by a team from the va ann arbor healthcare systems center for clinical management research and university of michigan medical schools addiction center the researchers have already launched a followup study in a larger group of 480 nonveterans in a residential addiction treatment program and the studys authors note that the impat approach has the potential to be easily and inexpensively adopted by addiction treatment centers and groups worldwide through team members trained in standard psychological techniques caught in the middle these results highlight the need for addiction treatment programs to offer a multifaceted approach that doesnt only address substance use but also the other factors that might be driving substance use including pain says mark ilgen phd the studys lead author and a va and um psychologist specializing in addiction research weve shown that its possible to improve pain outcomes in people with addiction and even have some spillover effects on their substance use addiction treatment programs often have patients who suffer from chronic pain but offer few options to treat them ilgen says to make matters worse past studies of psychosocial approaches for pain have often excluded people with drug or alcohol problems addiction treatment programs do not usually have providers trained in pain care and many pain specialists will not treat people who also have addiction so patients are caught in the middle all 129 patients in the study most of them men in their 40s and 50s were receiving outpatient addiction treatment in a cbtbased nonabstinence setting at the ann arbor va half were randomly assigned to impat sessions the other half to support groups of peers led by a therapist where pain and addiction could be discussed combination approach impat combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with another psychosocial approach called acceptance and commitment therapy while the two approaches arent usually used together they are often used in pain treatment settings but those clinics and programs dont often accept people who also acknowledge they have addiction issues ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used the impat technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life this includes techniques to help people adapt to their pain find ways to distract themselves from their pain and think of ways to function in the face of pain we want to take the focus off pain and put it onto functioning and finding pleasurable ways to spend time ilgen says theres also a strong link between depression and pain pain is responsive to mood and mood is responsive to social support in an editorial accompanying the new paper another addiction and pain specialist william c becker phd of yale university and the connecticut va notes that the new results are even more impressive because impat was compared with another psychosocial approach the newly published study did show that one in five veterans randomly assigned to impat or the comparison approach did not actually attend any sessions likely because of delays in getting the sessions going the larger ongoing study based in an abstinencebased treatment facility in michigan and funded by the national institute on drug abuse has largely avoided that issue by decreasing the delay between study recruitment and the start of the treatment groups ilgen says the study in veterans was planned just before the rapid rise in and increased awareness of opioid painkiller addiction issues in the us while opioid addiction was one of the issues faced by veterans in the study most had issues with multiple substances the sharp rise in opioid addiction in recent years often among people who started taking the painkillers as treatment for acute or chronic pain has made the search for effective nondrug pain treatment options even more urgent ilgen notes longterm use of opioids can sometimes lead to a hypersensitivity to pain so there may actually be a causal link between use of these medications and pain he notes we need to study psychological pain management approaches in opioiddependent patients including those receiving addiction therapies such as buprenorphine in the meantime he notes people struggling with addiction who want to seek relief from pain should explore the full range of treatment options that have been shown to work in nonaddicted patients including physical therapy exercise and psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medications and while existing prescription guidelines do not explicitly prohibit the use of opioid painkillers in people with pain who have substance use disorders these guidelines recommend only using opioids sparingly and under close supervision he says
real,fort lauderdale fla july 26 2016 prnewswire new research published in lancet neurology and reported by cnn has found using a green tea extract decaffeinated in combination with cognitive training improves some measures of cognition and behavior in subjects with down syndrome eightyseven volunteers aged 16 to 34 with down syndrome were enrolled in the phase 2 randomized controlled trial the study was conducted at the imimhospital del mar medical research institute in barcelona spain participants were randomly assigned to take the decaffeinated green tea extract or placebo for one year all subjects also underwent cognitive training during the 12month trial after one year of treatment functional brain scans fmri showed that epigallocatechin3gallate egcgtreated subjects had improved neuronal connectivity in certain brain regions participants who took the green tea extract also scored significantly better on assessments of visual recognition memory inhibitory control and adaptive behavior compared with those who took the placebo its an important trial says dr steven hirsh director of clinical research for life extension in fort lauderdale fla the findings are very noteworthy and support further study in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and durations it is very encouraging that this catechin egcg from green tea extract has the potential to benefit people with down syndrome down syndrome is a genetic condition that affects about 250000 americans individuals with down syndrome have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21 the team of researchers led by dr rafael de la torre program director of imim hospital del mar medical research institute and study coprincipal investigator and dr mara dierssen group leader at center for genomic regulation barcelona spain and study coprincipal investigator proposed that egcg might have conferred these benefits by inhibiting an enzyme called dyrk1a which has been implicated in down syndrome and neurodegenerative conditions including alzheimer disease the level of dyrk1apositive cells is elevated in certain regions of alzheimer disease patients brains and is roughly 20fold higher in the frontal cortex compared to normal brains dyrk1a is implicated in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles via tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid plaques both of which are features of alzheimer disease tea catechins may also modulate the damaging effects of amyloidbeta several animal studies have found that egcg and related compounds from tea suppress amyloidbetainduced cognitive dysfunction and neurotoxicity other possible mechanisms by which egcg may influence cognition include epigenetic regulation restoration of mitochondrial function and antioxidative functions in an earlier pilot study supported by life extension drs de la torre and dierssens team showed that three months of egcg treatment improved symptoms in individuals with down syndrome and in mice with a downsyndromelike condition characterized by overexpression of dyrk1a we are excited that the benefits observed in the early pilot and preclinical research extended to this larger trial says luke g huber nd mba vice president of product innovation and scientific development at life extension this new research adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests compounds in green tea such as egcg may support cognitive health in acknowledging the novelty of their findings and calling for more research the spanish research team noted that this study is the first wellpowered trial that shows improvement in adaptive behavior functional academics and brainrelated changes in young adults with downs syndrome however more research is needed to clarify the nature of the beneficial association between the egcg

real,international study finds effective less toxic way to treat brain tumors newswise charlotte nc july 26 2016 prnewswireusnewswire physicians from carolinas healthcare systems neurosciences institute and levine cancer institute are among the authors of a study that was accepted for publication by the journal of the american medical association jama the study released on july 26 2016 shows that patients with the most common form of brain tumor can be treated in an effective and substantially less toxic way by omitting a widely used portion of radiation therapy these results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life anthony l asher md facs medical director at carolinas healthcare systems neurosciences institute and the senior author on the report and as well as stuart h burri md chairman department of radiation oncology at levine cancer institute began their research on this subject over 10 years ago in charlotte north carolina along with dr paul brown at mayo clinic they spearheaded an international multiinstitutional randomized trial that will ultimately improve the standard of care for patients with a specific type of brain tumor brain metastases by reducing the toxicity of their treatment without reducing the effectiveness typical therapies for these types of brain tumors include surgery whole brain radiation therapy and focused radiation also known as stereotactic radiosurgery we discovered that whole brain radiation added to focused radiation in the treatment of brain metastases in other words cancer that travels to the brain reduces the number of new brain tumors over time however patients receiving the whole brain radiation had significantly more difficulties with memory and complex thinking than patients who only had the focused radiation says dr asher whole brain radiation patients also reported worse quality of life compared with patients who only received the focused radiation adds dr burri interestingly the data showed that the addition of whole brain radiation produced no improvement in survival according to the american cancer society in 2016 there will be approximately 17 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the united states almost one in four of those patients about 400000 will experience spread of their cancers to the brain in contrast 300000 and 240000 patients will be newly diagnosed with breast and primary lung cancers respectively each year brain metastases are not only extremely common they are also a major source of disability in society says dr asher because of their location these tumors often produce severe neurological symptoms such as headaches weakness or problems with speech and information processing thereby compromising both daily function and quality of life in cancer patients according to dr asher there are two primary objectives in cancer care to improve survivalto maintain or improve quality of life for patientsthe first and highest rule of medical care is do no harm says dr asher consistent with that obligation when it isnt possible to extend survival with various therapies its absolutely essential that we work to reduce or eliminate any possibility that quality of life will be compromised by treatments another way to state that principle for cancer care is that when two cancer therapies produce similar survival its important to understand which therapy offers patients a better quality of life in this study although whole brain radiation decreased the number of new brain tumors over time its addition to focused radiation interestingly did not result in a survival benefit over focused radiation alone furthermore whole brain therapy was associated with considerably worse quality of life in the past clinicians who treated patients with brain tumors seldom used sophisticated techniques like neurocognitive tests to evaluate patients daily function in response to various therapies said dr burri without those tests we might have incorrectly concluded that whole brain radiation was a better option for patients because it made their scans look better at least in the short term however the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients drs asher and burri emphasize that the real importance of this study is its potential to make us think differently about what really matters in cancer therapy the trial authors concluded that the benefit of adding whole brain radiation was outweighed by its risks in patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases this is a very relevant finding as over 200000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the united states each year and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number typically three or less of brain lesions drs asher and burri along with their coinvestigators now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life having the research published in jama is validation of more than a decade of work says dr burri it is deeply satisfying to have developed an important scientific project work in close collaboration with other investigators to obtain support from the national cancer institute then carry the to carry the trial to completion with publication of impactful results in one of the leading medical journals in the world drs asher and burri are now working on a new method of focused therapy for tumors that have spread to the brain that combines radiation and surgery the technique was pioneered at levine cancer institute and they are looking to expand and further

real,newswise eating a type of powdered food supplement based on a molecule produced by bacteria in the gut reduces cravings for highcalorie foods such as chocolate cake and pizza a new study suggests scientists from imperial college london and the university of glasgow asked 20 volunteers to consume a milkshake that either contained an ingredient called inulinpropionate ester or a type of fibre called inulin previous studies have shown bacteria in the gut release a compound called propionate when they digest the fibre inulin which can signal to the brain to reduce appetite however the inulinpropionate ester supplement releases much more propionate in the intestines than inulin alone after drinking the milkshakes the participants in the current study underwent an mri scan where they were shown pictures of various low or high calorie foods such as salad fish and vegetables or chocolate cake and pizza the team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulinpropionate ester they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward but only when looking at the high calorie foods these areas called the caudate and the nucleus accumbens found in the centre of the brain have previously been linked to food cravings and the motivation to want a food the volunteers also had to rate how appealing they found the foods the results showed when they drank the milkshake with the inulinpropionate ester supplement they rated the high calorie foods as less appealing in a second part of the study which is published in july edition of the american journal of clinical nutrition the volunteers were given a bowl of pasta with tomato sauce and asked to eat as much as they like when participants drank the inulinpropionate ester they ate 10 per cent less pasta than when they drank the milkshake that contained inulin alone in a previous research study by the same team published in 2013 they found that overweight volunteers who added the inulinpropionate ester supplement to their food every day gained less weight over six months compared to volunteers who added only inulin to their meals professor gary frost senior author of the study from the department of medicine at imperial said our previous findings showed that people who ate this ingredient gained less weight but we did not know why this study is filling in a missing bit of the jigsaw and shows that this supplement can decrease activity in brain areas associated with food reward at the same time as reducing the amount of food they eat he added that eating enough fibre to naturally produce similar amounts of propionate would be difficult the amount of inulinpropionate ester used in this study was 10g which previous studies show increases propionate production by 25 times to get the same increase from fibre alone we would need to eat around 60g a day at the moment the uk average is 15g claire byrne a phd researcher also from the department of medicine explained that using inulinpropionate ester as a food ingredient may help prevent weight gain if we add this to foods it could reduce the urge to consume high calorie foods she added that some peoples gut bacteria may naturally produce more propionate than others which may be why some people seem more naturally predisposed to gain weight dr tony goldstone cosenior author of the study from the department of medicine added this study adds to our previous brain imaging studies in people who have had gastric bypass surgery for obesity these show that altering how the gut works can change not only appetite in general but also change how the brain responds when they see highcalorie foods and how appealing they find the foods to be dr douglas morrison author of the paper from the scottish universities environmental research centre at the university of glasgow commented we developed inulinpropionate ester to investigate the role of propionate produced by the gut microbiota in human health this study illustrates very nicely that signals produced by the gut microbiota are important for appetite regulation and food choice this study also sheds new light on how diet the gut microbiome and health are inextricably linked adding to our understanding of how feeding our gut microbes with dietary fibre is important for healthy living the research was funded by the national institute for health research imperial biomedical research centre and the biotechnology and biological sciences research council cravings for highcalorie foods may be switched off in the brain by new supplement

real,consuming walnuts and select other whole foods as part of a healthy diet may be associated with a reduced risk of physical function impairments throughout the aging process in women folsom calif june 22 2016 a new study published in the journal of nutrition suggests that consuming 12 servings of walnuts per week 14 cup per serving was associated with reduced risk of developing impairments in physical function which helps enable older women to maintain independence throughout the aging process 1 this paper emphasized that overall diet quality rather than individual foods may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments specifically diet quality traits most associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment were higher intake of fruits and vegetables lower intake of sugarsweetened beverages trans fat and sodium and moderate alcohol intake among food components the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges orange juice apples pears romaine or leaf lettuce and walnuts theres a lot of research that looks at specific health conditions in aging such as diabetes and heart disease but less attention to research on quality of life and ability to maintain independence with aging said dr francine grodstein scd professor of medicine at brigham and womens hospital and harvard medical school the simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet including certain foods such as walnuts and other whole foods may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age like carrying groceries or dressing themselves the researchers looked at data from 54762 women in the nurses health study which tracked women for over 30 years between 1992 and 2008 the women were asked questions about their physical function including their ability to perform basic activities of daily living this new paper prospectively examined the association between the dietary habits of the participants and subsequent impairment in physical function diet was assessed using the alternative healthy eating index ahei2010 a measure of diet quality that incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk based on scientific evidence these results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women additional research is needed to better understand how diet and lifestyle choices can help maintain our health and wellbeing as we age said dr grodstein there are numerous possible active properties in walnuts that may be contributing factors in providing health benefits walnuts are unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat 13 grams per ounce which includes alphalinolenic acid ala the plantbased omega3 fatty acid they are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ala with 25 grams per one ounce serving some study limitations should be considered the sample only included women so these results may not be generalizable to men additionally participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods and were just asked about their dietary choices it is also possible that subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires in addition because this is an observational study residual confounding cannot be ruled out ie that other lifestyle habits which are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the study findings and thus the results should be interpreted with caution
real,postoperative cognitive dysfunction pocd a condition mostly observed in older patients following surgery under general anesthesia is characterized by impaired memory and concentration the impairment may be temporary or permanent and incapacitating the problem has become more frequent as the population ages and also as a growing number of older adults undergo surgical procedures made possible by more advanced medical technology data from the scientific literature suggest a rise in mortality from pocd in the first year after surgery under general anesthesia the good news according to a brazilian study published by the journal plos one is that two relatively simple measures can help to reduce the incidence of pocd administering a small dose of the antiinflammatory drug dexamethasone immediately before an operation and avoiding profound anesthesia during the operation opinions on the adequate depth of anesthesia and the risks of very profound anesthesia currently diverge excessively superficial anesthesia is known to incur a risk of patient recall of the procedure which is undesirable our findings confirm recent evidence that the deeper the anesthesiainduced hypnosis the higher the incidence of pocd the literature points to a link with the systemic inflammatory response induced by surgical trauma damaging the central nervous system if so the use of an antiinflammatory drug may have a protective effect said maria jos carvalho carmona a professor of anesthesiology at the university of so paulos medical school fmusp and principal investigator for the study the researchers evaluated 140 patients aged between 60 and 87 who underwent surgery under propofolinduced general anesthesia at the central institute of hospital das clnicas fmusps teaching hospital in most cases for removal of gallstones preoperative assessment included a battery of tests to measure mental and cognitive status patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded the remaining subjects were divided randomly into four groups in the operating room deep anesthesia typical of major surgical procedures was induced in the first and third groups and more superficial anesthesia in the second and fourth only the third and fourth groups received dexamethasone the depth of anesthesia was monitored using bispectral index bis technology which processes electroencephalogram signals to measure druginduced unconsciousness the researchers classified a bis of 3545 as deep anesthesia and a bis of 4655 as superficial anesthesia in the fourth group superficial anesthesia with dexamethasone the incidence of pocd was 153 immediately after surgery but after six months the preoperative cognitive status was restored in all patients the results reinforce recent evidence of the importance of avoiding deep anesthesia carmona said with regard to the use of dexamethasone more research is needed to confirm our finding preferably in multicenter trials but there are strong indications that it can be beneficial in many cases the earliest trials with patients who developed pocd were performed after the 1950s before that older patients were rarely subjected to major surgery and significant research in this field has only been conducted for approximately 1520 years the causes of and risk factors for pocd are still being discussed she said little is said about rehabilitation or ways of helping patients recover preoperative cognitive function one of the obstacles to reliable diagnosis and rehabilitation is a lack of practical and secure instruments for pre and postoperative cognitive assessment the tests available today are either too time consuming or quick but unreliable carmona said this makes it hard to follow up on patients
real,daily treatment with the antiviral drug tenofovir during the third trimester of pregnancy reduced the mothertochild transmission rate of hepatitis b hbv from 18 percent to 5 percent according to the findings of a clinical trial led by researchers from nyu langone medical center and published on june 16 in the new england journal of medicine the study focused on the most common way that children become infected with hepatitis b an incurable viral infection that causes liver disease and cancer which is through infection during the perinatal period without intervention 80 to 90 percent of infants who are born to mothers infected with hepatitis b develop a chronic infection the current standard of care is to provide vaccine and immune globulin to reduce transmission rates preventing mothertochild transmission is the most effective way to reduce the global burden of chronic hepatitis b infection and liver cancer says calvin pan md lead author of the study and a clinical professor of medicine at nyu langone we believe that these findings will not only save many lives but could also help to eradicate hepatitis b nationally and abroad the study was conducted in five locations in china where hbv infection is endemic pan and colleagues enrolled 200 pregnant women with a high viral load defined as one million copies of the virus per milliliter in a blood sample participants were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no antiviral therapy or to a second group that received a daily dose of 300 milligrams of tenofovir in pill form beginning at 30 or 32 weeks of pregnancy and continuing until 4 weeks after delivery treatment effectively reduced the viral load of the pregnant women says pan before delivery 68 percent of tenofovirtreated mothers had hbv loads below 1 million copies per milliliter compared to 2 percent of nontreated mothers in terms of safety researchers found that tenofovir was well tolerated only one participant treated with tenofovir voluntarily withdrew from the study due to nausea among the children born during the study pan and his colleagues found no significant differences between the tenofovirtreated group and the control group with regard to fetal development and infant growth this study provides strong evidence on how best to care for women infected with hepatitis b during pregnancy and reduce the rate of disease transmission says mark pochapin md the sholtzleeds professor of gastroenterology and director of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at nyu langone based on the findings the investigators recommend that women be tested for hbv viral load at week 28 of pregnancy those with a high viral load should receive tenofovir treatment starting at gestational week 30 until delivery to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants in addition infants should receive hepatitis b vaccine and immune globulin moving forward longer term observational studies are needed to confirm the safety of fetal exposure to tenofovir treatment says pan this research was supported by gilead sciences dr pans coauthors were zhong ping duan at beijing youan hospital capital medical university in beijing er hei dai and bao shen zhu at fifth hospital of shijiazhuang hebei medical university shijiazhuang shu qing zhang and wen jing zhao at hepatobiliary disease hospital of ji lin province changchun guorong han and hongxiu jiang at second affiliated hospital of southeast university nanjing yuming wang at institute for infectious diseases southwest hospital third military medical university chongqing huai bin zou at youan hospital capital medical university beijing and huai hong zhang at nanyang center hospital nanyang henan all for the china study group for the mothertochild transmission of hepatitis b media inquiries rob magyar phone 2124043591 robertmagyar org antiviral treatment during pregnancy reduces mothertochild transmission of hepatitis b
real,east hanover nj june 22 2016 prnewswire a new analysis published today in jama cardiology has found that timely and broad adoption of entresto sacubitrilvalsartan by all eligible heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction hfref could prevent or postpone more than 28000 deaths each year in the us alone1 this analysis based on an application of the results of paradigmhf to published heart failure statistics is the first to quantify the possible impact of entrestos potential benefit in reducing death1 heart failure is a chronic condition that contributes to more than 300000 deaths in the us every year4 about half of people with heart failure have hfref5 this new analysis estimates that as many as 28484 deaths in hfref patients annually could be prevented or postponed with optimal use of entresto with sensitivity analyses demonstrating a range of 18230 to 410171 further the study suggests that delaying routine use of entresto in clinical practice could have a substantial negative effect on patients given the expected riskbenefit profile as it could result in failure to prevent tens of thousands of deaths1 these findings demonstrate the significant survival benefits entresto could offer to those living with hfref if patients in the group defined by the authors were given access to treatment1 the study authors stated that nearly 84 of hfref patients 22 million people may be candidates for treatment with entresto1 heart failure is a lifethreatening condition and despite available medicines about half of patients diagnosed with heart failure die within 5 years467 according to the study authors these findings may substantially impact the national health of the hfref population offering significant clinical benefit in preventing or postponing death when applied in clinical practice1 this expert analysis adds to the already compelling case for the treatment of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction with entresto said fabrice chouraqui president of novartis pharmaceuticals corporation in addition to survival benefits the study also recognizes other treatment effects of entresto particularly in reducing hf hospitalizations1 coupled with the recent class i recommendation the strongest endorsement in the focused update to the us hf guideline2 these findings underscore the potential of entresto as a standard therapy for chronic hfref patients in a separate analysis published in the same issue of jama cardiology researchers used data from the paradigmhf trial to model the health consequences and costeffectiveness of entresto over a 30year time period3 they compared entresto to the aceinhibitor enalapril and found entresto was associated with more than a year longer average survival time and that it was costeffective compared to enalapril when these medications were used with other standard of care therapies3 for every 1000 patients treated with entresto vs enalapril potentially 597 hf hospital admissions could be averted per each year alive in the model3 in addition entresto increased life expectancy at an incremental costeffectiveness ratio consistent with other highvalue widely accepted cardiovascular interventions such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds and cholesterollowering statins before they became generic3 about heart failure heart failure is a debilitating and lifethreatening condition which impacts nearly 6 million americans and is the leading cause of hospitalization among americans over the age of 6548 about half of people with heart failure have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction hfref5 reduced ejection fraction means the heart does not contract with enough force so less blood is pumped out9 heart failure presents a major and growing healtheconomic burden that currently exceeds 30 billion in the united states which accounts for both direct and indirect costs10 about entresto entresto is a twiceaday medicine that reduces the strain on the failing heart it does this by enhancing the protective neurohormonal systems natriuretic peptide system while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas11 other heart failure medicines only block the harmful effects of the overactive raas12 entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker arb valsartan11 entresto is indicated in the us to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure nyha class iiiv and reduced ejection fraction11 entresto is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies in place of an angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor or an angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb11 entresto filmcoated tablets are available in three dosage strengths 2426 mg 4951 mg and 97103 mg sacubitrilvalsartan11 these doses are referred to as 50 mg 100 mg

real,boston to date there are no methods that can quickly and accurately detect pathogens in blood to allow the diagnosis of systemic bloodstream infections that can lead to lifethreatening sepsis the standard of care for detecting such bloodborne infections is blood culture but this takes days to complete only identifies pathogens in less than 30 of patients with fulminant infections and it is not able to detect toxic fragments of dead pathogens that also drive the exaggerated inflammatory reactions leading to sepsis biomarkers that report elevated inflammation are used clinically in the treatment of patients with sepsis however they fail to distinguish inflammation triggered by infectious pathogens from that induced by noninfectious causes such as burns traumas and surgeries now a wyss institute team led by donald ingber reports in ebiomedicine that it has filled this void with a rapid and specific diagnostic assay that could help physicians decide within an hour whether a patient has a systemic infection and should be hospitalized for aggressive intervention therapy the potential of this assay to detect pathogen materials was demonstrated in both animal studies and a prospective human clinical study whose results also suggest that it also could serve as a companion diagnostic to monitor the success of antibiotic and dialysislike sepsis therapies our pathogen detection technology solves both dilemmas it quickly reports whether infectious pathogens are present in the body even at early stages of infection before sepsis develops and it can more specifically identify patients who have excessive inflammation due to systemic infection rather than other causes said donald ingber md phd the wyss institutes founding director the judah folkman professor of vascular biology at harvard medical school and the vascular biology program at boston childrens hospital and professor of bioengineering at the harvard john a paulson school of engineering and applied sciences this assay could become a real game changer in this clinical area and it also should lead to more judicious use of antibiotics helping to decrease the worrisome rise we are seeing in antibioticresistant organisms in a cohort of emergency room patients with suspected sepsis we saw that the assay picked up infection within an hour in 85 of patients who exhibited clinical symptoms of sepsis and equally importantly it did not falsely predict infection in healthy subjects or patients with inflammation triggered by other causes such as trauma on the other hand blood cultures that we performed in parallel using the same samples only detected pathogens in 18 of the cases said nathan shapiro md phd director of translational research in the center for vascular biology research at bidmc who worked with ingbers team to conduct the clinical study this highlights the advance this technology represents the diagnostic assay is built on fcmbl a genetically engineered pathogenbinding protein previously developed by ingber and michael super a wyss senior staff scientist who coleads the institutes pathogendetecting effort fcmbl binds to pathogens and pathogenreleased fragments known as pathogenassociated molecular patterns pamps by recognizing carbohydrate molecules on their surface previous efforts in ingbers team at the wyss institute have established fcmbl as a key component of an advanced dialysislike pathogenextracting therapeutic device and of a method for the fast retrieval of infectious pathogens from complex clinical samples to enable their identification and antibody susceptibilities in our latest work we show that the fcmblbased pathogendetecting assay is considerably faster and more accurate than any other available assay for systemic infection we are currently working to ready it for highthroughput use in clinical and point of care situations and to accelerate it even further said mark cartwright phd a staff scientist at the wyss institute and a leadauthor on the study as a prerequisite to their clinical study the wyss institutes team had successfully tested the assay in rat and pig models of infection with pathogenic e coli bacteria the animal models clearly told us that the assay can sensitively trace spikes of pamps released during antibiotic therapy or residual infectious pamp materials even when no living bacteria circulate anymore in blood but they remain hidden inside internal organs thus this assay could be an excellent tool for monitoring ongoing infection and responses to antibiotics and dialysislike therapies for severe infections and sepsis said mike super phd together the findings suggest that the fcmblbased pathogen detection technology with its rapid handling time high sensitivity and broad specificity towards infectioncausing pathogens could provide a realworld advance to diagnose lifethreatening infections in both clinical microbiology laboratories and pointofcare settings
real,toronto june 8 2016 eating barley or foods containing barley significantly reduced levels of two types of bad cholesterol associated with cardiovascular risk a st michaels hospital research paper has found barley reduced both lowdensity lipoprotein or ldl and nonhighdensity lipoprotein or nonhdl by seven per cent the review also indicated that barley had similar cholesterollowering effects as oats which is often the goto grain for health benefits the research review published today in the european journal of clinical nutrition included 14 studies on clinical trials conducted in seven countries including canada it is the first study to look at the effects of barley and barley products on both ldl and nonhdl cholesterol in addition to apolipoprotein b or apob a lipoprotein that carries bad cholesterol through the blood measuring nonhdl and apob provides a more accurate assessment for cardiovascular risk as they account for the total bad cholesterol found in the blood the findings are most important for populations at high risk for cardiovascular disease such as type 2 diabetics who have normal levels of ldl cholesterol but elevated levels of nonhdl or apo b said dr vladimir vuksan research scientist and associate director of the risk factor modification centre of st michaels barley has a lowering effect on the total bad cholesterol in these highrisk individuals but can also benefit people without high cholesterol high cholesterol and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke historically treated with medications however dr vuksans research and work focuses on how dietary and lifestyle changes can reduce these risk factors barleys positive effect on lowering cholesterol is welldocumented and has been included in the canadian strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk said dr vuksan health canada the fda and several health authorities worldwide have already approved health claims that barley lowers ldl cholesterol but this is the first review showing the effects on other harmful lipids despite its benefits dr vuksan said barley is not as wellestablished as some other healthrecommended foods such as oats barley consumption by humans has fallen by 35 per cent in the last 10 years canada is one of the top five world producers of barley almost 10 megatonnes per year but human consumption accounts for only two per cent of the crop yield with livestock making up the other 98 per cent after looking at the evidence we can also say that barley is comparably effective as oats in reducing overall risk of cardiovascular disease said dr vuksan barley is higher in fibre has twice the protein and almost half the calories of oats which are important considerations for those with weight or dietary concerns dr vuksan said barley can be enjoyed in a variety of ways he recommends trying to incorporate barley into existing recipes using it as a substitute for rice or even on its own just like oatmeal
real,chicago about 80 percent of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis saw their disease completely or almost completely cleared with a new drug called ixekizumab according to three large longterm clinical trials led by northwestern medicine the results of these phase iii trials were compiled in a paper published in the new england journal of medicine this group of studies not only shows very high and consistent levels of safety and efficacy but also that the great majority of the responses persist at least 60 weeks said dr kenneth gordon a professor of dermatology at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine and first author of the paper affecting about 3 percent of the worlds population psoriasis is an immunemediated inflammatory disease that causes itchy dry and red skin it is also associated with an increased risk for depression heart disease and diabetes among other conditions ixekizumab works by neutralizing a pathway in the immune system known to promote psoriasis to test the drugs efficacy over time and to help clinicians determine whether its benefits outweigh any risks the three studies enrolled a total of 3736 adult patients at more than 100 study sites in 21 countries all participants had moderate to severe psoriasis which is defined as covering 10 percent or more of the body patients were randomly assigned to receive injections of ixekizumab at various doses or a placebo over a period of more than a year the investigators assessed whether the drug reduced the severity of psoriasis symptoms compared to the placebo and evaluated safety by monitoring adverse events by the 12th week 764 to 818 percent of patients has their psoriasis classified as clear or minimal compared to 32 of patients on the placebo by the 60th week 687 to 783 percent of patients had maintained their improvement based on these findings we expect that 80 percent of patients will have an extremely high response rate to ixekizumab and about 40 percent will be completely cleared of psoriasis gordon said ten years ago we thought complete clearance of this disease was impossible it wasnt something we would even try to do now with this drug were obtaining response levels higher than ever seen before adverse events associated with ixekizumab included slightly higher rates of neutropenia low white blood cell count yeast infection and inflammatory bowel disease compared to the placebo the safety of therapy longer than 60 weeks will need to be monitored in the future the drug has been approved by the food and drug administration since the trials were completed
real,newswise chicago a single breath may be all it takes to identify the return of lung cancer after surgery according to a study posted online today by the annals of thoracic surgery exhaled breath contains thousands of volatile organic compounds vocs that vary in composition and pattern depending on a persons health status a subset of four vocscalled carbonyl compounds because of their carbon basehave been discovered in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients being able to identify this lung cancer signature through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence erin m schumer md mph victor van berkel md phd and colleagues from the university of louisville analyzed breath samples collected before and after surgery from 31 lung cancer patients and compared their carbonyl vocs levels with samples from 187 healthy patients the researchers found a significant decrease in overall carbonyl voc levels following surgery in fact three of the four carbonyl vocs normalized after surgery matching levels in the control group the rapid normalization of almost all of the four compounds after surgery provides strong evidence that they are directly produced by the tumor environment said dr schumer this study confirms that the technology is accurate lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death the american cancer society acs estimates that more than 224000 americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year and more than 158000 lung cancer patients will diethat translates to 433 lung cancer deaths per day in the united states dr schumer said those grim statistics underscore the need for early detection we hope that breath analysis will allow us to diagnose patients with primary or recurrent lung cancer long before they suffer from symptoms when we have more options for treating them giving them the best chance for cure currently lung cancer patients are followed after surgery with chest computed tomography ct scans which can be inconvenient expensive and expose the patient to radiation we hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a ct scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change said dr van berkel how the breath test worksthe process of breath analysis is relatively simple the patient blows a single breath into a specialized balloon the balloon is then connected to a pump that pulls the breath over a small microchip smaller than a quarter trapping the chemicals the microchip is sent to the lab where the chemicals are analyzed within hours breath collection can be performed in the doctors office the pump is reusable the balloon microchip and lab test together cost around 20 all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a costeffective easytoperform noninvasive and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer the great potential with breath analysis is detecting lung cancer at any point both as a primary screening tool and to follow patients after disease has been treated said dr van berkel the technology is pretty robust our next step is getting approval from the fda

mm36 is a topical phosphodiesterase 4 pde4 inhibitor under development for the treatment of ad results showed a therapeutic benefit as measured by percentage change in easi score and improvement in iga score mm36 is expected to be the 2nd topical pde4 inhibitor available in the us and may offer unique benefits for patients suffering from ad medimetriks pharmaceuticals inc today announces the publication of phase 2 results for mm36 previously referred to as opa15406 a novel topical nonsteroidal phosphodiesterase iv pde4 inhibitor for the treatment of mildtomoderate atopic dermatitis the successful results of the phase 2 trial of mm36 have been published by the journal of the american academy of dermatology jaad the leading peerreviewed journal in dermatology the randomized doubleblind vehiclecontrolled study in 121 patients showed that mm36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in iga score investigators global assessment and percentage change in easi score eczema area and severity index the mean percentage improvement in baseline easi score was notable very early at week 1 314 vs 6 for vehicle p0005 and at week 2 390 vs 3 for vehicle p0001 these effects were sustained through week 8 of the study mm36 was also associated with improvement in patientreported outcomes most notably rapid and sustained itch relief with visual analog scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week 364 mean change p0011 mm36 a pde4 inhibitor reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis in particular mm36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against pde4 subtype b an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation mm36 is expected to be the 2nd topical pde4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of anacor pharmaceuticals crisaborole product the results of the phase 2 study suggest that mm36 represents a potentially safe effective and welltolerated nonsteroidal treatment for mildtomoderate atopic dermatitis said linda stein gold md director of clinical research department of dermatology at henry ford hospital and coauthor of the article based on the results of this study it appears that mm36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology we are pleased that jaad the most respected peerreviewed journal in dermatology published the phase 2 results said bradley glassman chairman and chief executive officer of medimetriks we believe these phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of mm36s capacity to be a leading topical pde4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing mm36

results can be found by visiting wwwjaadorg about atopic dermatitis atopic dermatitis ad is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red swollen and cracked skin with intense itching the onset of ad occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age with approximately 60 of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90 by 5 years of age the majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood although 10 to 30 of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives a small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults it has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with ad in the us and this disease accounts for up to 20 of patient visits to dermatology offices current treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective antiinflammatory agents however topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time including skin atrophy acne and telangiectasias locally and hpa axis suppression systemically topical calcineurin inhibitors tcis are recommended as secondline treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroidrelated side effects tcis carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma although studies have not demonstrated a clear link their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging

real,a healthy intake of vitamin d in the first year of life appears to set children up to have more muscle mass and less body fat as toddlers according to a new study published in the journal pediatric obesity the findings emerged from research initially aimed at confirming the importance of vitamin d for bone density the additional benefit in terms of body composition came as a surprise for the research team we were very intrigued by the higher lean mass the possibility that vitamin d can help infants to not only grow healthy skeletons but also healthy amounts of muscle and less fat said hope weiler one of the studys authors and director of the mary emily clinical nutrition research unit at mcgill university for the first time a connection was made between the benefits of achieving healthy vitamin d status during a babys first 12 to 36 months and how muscle mass develops the researchers achieved this by following up on a 2013 study in which 132 infants in montral qubec were given a vitamin d3 supplement at one of four different dosages between the ages of 1 month and 12 months the new study confirmed the importance for the development of strong bones of a vitamin d supplement of 400 iuday during a babys first year this amount is in line with current canadian health guidelines the researchers found that higher doses did not provide any additional benefit at least not in terms of bone development but the body scans used to assess bone density also allowed the team to measure the childrens muscle and fat mass while there were no significant differences in body composition across the different dosage groups the researchers found children who had vitamin d stores above the threshold recommended by the canadian paediatric society cps averaged around 450 grams less body fat at 3 years of age supplements important in long winters vitamin d supplementation is routinely recommended for babies until they can get an adequate amount through their diet the skin synthesizes vitamin d when exposed to sunlight making supplementation all the more important where long winters reduce the opportunity for this to happen in addition health canada advises parents and caregivers to avoid direct sunlight and avoid use of sun block creams in young infants physical activity also reduces body fat further analysis also indicated a correlation between lean muscle mass and the average level of vitamin d in the body over the first three years of a childs life the only other factor found to make a significant difference to the childrens amount of body fat was their level of physical activity
real,with a cure rate approaching 90 percent acute lymphoblastic leukemia all the most common type of childhood cancer is often hailed as one of the success stories of modern cancer treatment but up to 20 percent of patients with a high risk of relapse are not cured that could change with the results from a clinical trial coled by investigators from nyu langone medical center which shows giving high doses of a commonlyused chemotherapy drug increases the survival rate for these patients the highdose methotrexate protocol outlined in the study along with a parallel finding that the steroid decadron is beneficial for younger but not older patients has quickly become the standard practice for the treatment of highrisk all patients in north america the researchers report in the april xx issue of the journal of clinical oncology for more than 50 years all patients have been treated with a combination of steroids and methotrexate among other agents patients classified as high risk for relapsethose with a high white blood cell count or who are more than 10 years oldare treated with a standard phase of therapy where methotrexate is given in a gradual escalating dosage the current study showed that an alternative schedule of highdose methotrexate was superior prior to the release of the initial study results which were first presented last year at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology asco the standard of care for highrisk all patients in north america was escalating methotrexate one of the improvements in outcome for all overall has been using methotrexate in a more intense fashion by giving higher doses said senior investigator william l carroll md the julie and edward j minskoff professor of pediatrics director of the stephen d hassenfeld childrens center for cancer and blood disorders at nyu langone and director emeritus of nyu langones perlmutter cancer center we designed this study to compare high dose and escalating methotrexate to determine the best way to use this drug to increase the survival of highrisk all patients this was a largescale study involving pediatric cancer centers across the country more than 3000 patients with highrisk all were enrolled in the randomized clinical trial which was run by the childrens oncology group a multiinstitutional clinical trials consortium supported by the national cancer institute the investigators found that patients in either arm responded very well overall to treatments but those in the high dose group had a significantly better outcome by 5 to 6 percent which translated into a significantly decreased relapse rate for these patients the clinical protocol also examined how to best use a steroid formulation called decadron to treat highrisk all patients steroids as a class of drugs are one of the most effective medications in the treatment of all previous studies by the childrens oncology group showed that in standard risk all patientsthose with low white blood cell counts or under 10 years of agedecadron prevented relapse in both the spinal fluid and in the bone marrow decadron however can increase the infection rate particularly in highrisk all patients when given for the full 28day induction period during this clinical trial the investigators decreased the duration of decadron from 28 days to 14 to determine if patients could avoid the side effect of increased infection while still benefiting from the steroids antileukemic effects they found that patients 10 years and older saw no benefit from decadron and in fact were at much higher risk for a debilitating bone condition called osteonecrosis patients under 10 years of age however did benefit from the shorter decadron exposure with no increased side effects the improvement in cure rates for all over the last few decades for the most part has not come through the introduction of new medications but through using existing medications in new ways in terms of their dose and schedule dr carroll said this clinical trial illustrates that despite what seem to be remarkable outcomes for kids with all we have not reached a plateau the outcomes are getting better and better
real,research at group health points to bupropion wellbutrin as first choice for overweight and obese patients with depression seattlegroup health researchers have found that bupropion marketed as wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to longterm modest weight loss previously group health researchers showed a twoway street between depression and body weight people with depression are more likely to be overweight and vice versa these researchers also found that most antidepressant medications have been linked to weight gain prior research on antidepressants and weight change was limited to one year or shorter but many people take antidepressantsthe most commonly prescribed medications in the united statesfor longer than a year so for up to two years the new study followed more than 5000 group health patients who started taking an antidepressant the journal of clinical medicine published it longterm weight change after initiating secondgeneration antidepressants our study suggests that bupropion is the best initial choice of antidepressant for the vast majority of americans who have depression and are overweight or obese said study leader david arterburn md mph hes a senior investigator at group health research institute ghri a group health physician and an affiliate associate professor in the university of washington uw school of medicines department of medicine but in some cases an overweight or obese patient has reasons why bupropion is not for themlike a history of seizure disorderand it would be better for them to choose a different treatment option study findings we found that bupropion is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to weight loss over two years dr arterburn said all other antidepressants are linked to varying degrees of weight gain after two years nonsmokers lost an average of 24 pounds on bupropioncompared with gaining an average of 46 pounds on fluoxetine prozac so those who took bupropion ended up weighing 7 pounds less than did those on fluoxetine unsurprisingly that difference wasnt seen in people who smoked tobacco bupropion is often used to help patients stop smoking so smokers who take bupropion are likely to be trying to quitand coping with the weight gain that often accompanies attempts to quit smoking who should try which antidepressant a large body of evidence indicates no difference in how effectively the newer antidepressants improve peoples moods said dr arterburns coauthor gregory simon md mph a group health psychiatrist ghri senior investigator and research professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the uw school of medicine so it makes sense for doctors and patients to choose antidepressants on the basis of their side effects costs and patients preferencesand now on whether patients are overweight or obese bupropion should be considered the firstline drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese dr simon said but patients should consult their doctor about which medication is right for them before making any changes including starting switching or stopping medication
real,patients receiving cancer treatment could increase their chance of survival by up to 20 and help stop their cancer from spreading by taking a lowdose of aspirin new research suggests in a systematic review of the available scientific literature a team from cardiff universitys school of medicine found a significant reduction in mortality and cancer spread by patients who took a lowlevel dose of aspirin in addition to their cancer treatment average study followup length over 5 years there is a growing body of evidence that taking aspirin is of significant benefit in reducing some cancers said professor peter elwood who led the research published in the journal plos one whilst we know a lowdose of aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of cancer its role in the treatment of cancer remains uncertain as a result we set out to conduct a systematic search of all the scientific literature the teams review looked at all of the available data including five randomised trials and forty two observational studies of colorectal breast and prostate cancers professor elwood said our review based on the available evidence suggests that lowdose aspirin taken by patients with bowel breast or prostate cancer in addition to other treatments is associated with a reduction in deaths of about 1520 together with a reduction in the spread of the cancer the results from six studies of other cancers also suggest a reduction but the numbers of patients were too few to enable confident interpretation a mutation known as pik3ca was present in about 20 of patients and appeared to explain much of the reduction in colon cancer mortality by aspirin one of the concerns about taking aspirin remains the potential for intestinal bleeding thats why we specifically looked at the available evidence of bleeding and we wrote to all authors asking for further data in no study was serious or lifethreatening bleeding reported as a result of the review the team say their study highlights the need for randomised trials to establish the evidence needed to support lowdose aspirin as an effective additional treatment of cancer professor elwood added while there is a desperate need for more detailed research to verify our review and to obtain evidence on less common cancers wed urge patients diagnosed with cancer to speak to their doctor about our findings so they can make an informed decision as to whether or not they should take a lowdose aspirin as part of their cancer treatment this is not the only significant study professor elwood led research examining ways to improve peoples health in 1974 elwoods team reported the very first randomised trial of aspirin in the prevention of vascular mortality in the british medical journal professor elwood also led a major study which monitored the health habits of 2235 men over a 35year period and found that exercise significantly reduces the risk of dementia the study was the longest of its kind to probe the influence of environmental factors in chronic disease the study identified five healthy behaviours as being integral to having the best chance of leading a diseasefree lifestyle taking regular exercise nonsmoking a healthy bodyweight a healthy diet and a low alcohol intake

real,durham nc most highrisk lung cancer patients might not need annual lowdose computed tomography ldct screenings if they are cleared of disease in their initial test according to a study led by a duke cancer institute researcher the researchers found that even former heavy smokers appear to have a reduced incidence of lung cancer if their initial ldct screening is negative suggesting that less frequent screening might be warranted this has significant public policy implications said edward f patz jr md the james and alice chen professor of radiology at duke and lead author of a study published online march 21 2016 in the lancet oncology journal not screening patients annually could save millions in health care costs and spare patients the radiation exposure and the downstream effects of false positive screenings patz and colleagues analyzed data from the national lung screening trial a large prospective study that randomly assigned former smokers to either receive three annual lowdose ct scans or three chest radiographs for the early detection of lung cancer patients were ages 5574 who had smoked for the equivalent of 30 years one pack a day for 30 years two packs a day for 15 years etc the researchers identified study participants in the ctscan group whose initial screening was negative they then compared those patients to other ctscan recipients whose screenings detected an abnormality to assess any differences in lung cancer incidence and lung cancerspecific deaths of the initial 19066 participants with a negative initial ldct scan 444 2 percent were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available followup in the first year after a negative screen and before the scheduled first annual screen 17 patients 009 percent of all initial negative ldct participants were diagnosed with lung cancer an additional 75 patients 04 percent of the initial negative group were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening the incidence of lung cancer at the first screen among those who were initially negative was 034 percent compared to 1 percent of patients who were diagnosed during the baseline screening the researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in at most an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the ldct group 186 vs 212 deaths per 100000 per years over the course of the study our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan and future risk prediction and costeffectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines patz said he added that improving the accuracy of ldct screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens nearly 40 percent of ldct patients in the national lung screening trial had false positives sometime during the seven years the study examined
real,orlando fla researchers at orlando health detected evidence of concussions in patients up to 7 days after their injury using a simple blood test according to a new study published in jama neurology the discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms symptoms of a concussion or a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury can be subtle and are often delayed in many cases by several days said linda papa md msc an emergency medicine physician and nih funded researcher at orlando health and lead author of the study this could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients particularly children and making sure they are treated properly its estimated nearly a quarter of a million children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports an average of nearly 700 a day almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms which are either observed like vomiting or loss of balance or symptoms reported by the child like blurred vision or headaches neither scenario gives doctors and objective way to determine the severity of the injury if patients are not diagnosed properly and treated appropriately it could lead to longterm problems said papa untreated or undertreated traumatic brain injuries like concussions can lead to prolonged bouts with headaches dizziness memory loss and depression this test could take the guesswork out of making a diagnosis by allowing doctors to simply look for a specific biomarker in the blood the biomarker papa analyzed is known as a glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap these proteins are found in glial cells which surround neurons in the brain and when an injury occurs the gfap are released what makes them unique is that they pass the bloodbrain barrier and enter the bloodstream making them easy to detect with this particular test not only were they present in the bloodstream we were able to detect measurable levels of gfap up to a week after the injury said papa researchers analyzed nearly 600 patients for 3 years when crosschecked with scans the blood test was able to detect mild to moderate traumatic brain lesions with up to 97 percent accuracy in patients 18 years and older the blood test also indicated which patients were in need of lifesaving neurosurgery this suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury this is important because many patients with concussion may not seek medical attention for days after injury the blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography ct scans currently ct scans are the most precise way to diagnose brain lesions but are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure physicians really want to minimize the amount of cts in patients especially children who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it fortunately this simple blood test appears to give us nearly the same information as a ct scan in fact in a previous study published last fall papa and her team at orlando health tested both they analyzed 152 children within 6 hours of sustaining a concussion or mild to moderate traumatic brain injury the results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy nearly as effective as stateofthe art ct scans this could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions not only in children but in anyone who sustains a head injury said papa we have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body like the heart liver and kidneys but theres never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain we think this test could change that she said
real,newswise montreal march 22 2016 the proportion of older adults with agerelated vision loss is estimated to be as high as one in three over the age of 50 in canada thats roughly 36 million people many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text but these devices can be prohibitively expensive unifunctional and bulky enter the ipad a technological device thats relatively cheap serves many purposes is smaller than most books and according to new research from concordia university in montreal is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices a study recently described in good times magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the apple ipad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment and that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled for the study the concordiabased research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97 a little over half the participants had agerelated macular degeneration a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading the researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants visual ability and then compared the apple ipad versus two traditionally used magnification devices to see if reading rates varied across devices unsurprisingly we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier says elliott morrice an ma student in concordias department of psychology and the studys first author what was interesting to note was that it didnt matter what technology was used to do the magnification an ipad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system cctv he says when we took previous experience into account we found that participants who had used ipads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the ipad for the first time but there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the cctv compared to the reading rates of firsttime cctv users another benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices because they identify them as having an impairment or disability tablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable says aaron johnson the studys senior author and an associate professor in the psychology department and a member of the centre for interdisciplinary research in rehabilitation of greater montreal crir whats more compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision ipads are multifunctional allowing the user to go online check email make video calls and they cost less than the traditional devices he says this cost saving can be both to the individual and if appropriate to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices partners in research this work was supported in part by the vision health research network the fonds de recherche du qubc sant the antoine turmel foundation crir and the mabmackay foundation the studys third coauthor is julieandre marinier from the centre de recherche interdisciplinaire en radaptation du montral mtropolitain and cole doptomtrie at the universit de montral walter wittich is a member of crir an assistant professor in lcole doptomtrie at universit de montral and an affiliated faculty member of the department of psychology at concordia university related linksdepartment of psychologycentre de recherche interdisciplinaire en radaptation du montral mtropolitaincole doptomtrie at the universit de montralmabmackay rehabilitation centre can an ipad help you see

real,calcium in the arteries of the breast predicts early buildup of plaque in the hearts arteries and may improve risk assessment in many women especially young women routine mammographywidely recommended for breast cancer screeningmay also be a useful tool to identify women at risk for heart disease potentially allowing for earlier intervention according to a study scheduled for presentation at the american college of cardiologys 65th annual scientific session data from this study show for the first time a link between the amount of calcium in the arteries of the breastreadily visible on digital mammographyand the level of calcium buildup in the coronary arteries coronary arterial calcification or cac is considered a very early sign of cardiovascular disease importantly the presence of breast arterial calcification also appears to be an equivalent or stronger risk factor for cac than other wellestablished cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol high blood pressure and diabetes earlier research had shown a link between breast arterial calcification and atherosclerotic diseaseeven heart attack stroke and other cardiovascular disease events but researchers said these data provide a more direct relationship between the extent of calcified plaque in the mammary and coronary arteries as well as a comparison to standard risk evaluation many women especially young women dont know the health of their coronary arteries based on our data if a mammogram shows breast arterial calcifications it can be a red flagan aha momentthat there is a strong possibility she also has plaque in her coronary arteries said harvey hecht md professor at the icahn school of medicine and director of cardiovascular imaging at mount sinai st lukes hospital and lead author of the study all told 70 percent of the women who had evidence of breast arterial calcification on their mammogram were also found to have cac as shown on a noncontrast ct scan of the chest for women under 60 years of age with cac half also had breast arterial calcificationan important finding as very few would be thinking about or considered for early signs of heart disease there were even fewer false positives among younger patients researchers said that if a younger woman had breast arterial calcification there was an 83 percent chance she also had cac notably breast arterial calcification also appeared to be as strong a predictor for cardiovascular risk as standard risk scores such as the framingham risk score which underestimates womens risk and the 2013 cholesterol guidelines pooled cohort equations which tends to overestimate risk hecht said when researchers added 33 asymptomatic women with established cad breast arterial calcification was more powerful than both risk assessment formulas which suggests the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis may be a more important indicator of heart disease than other risk factors this information is available on every mammogram with no additional cost or radiation exposure and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factorbased estimate for predicting risk hecht said using this information would allow atrisk women to be referred for standard cac scoring and to be able to start focusing on preventionperhaps even taking a statin when it can make the most difference multivariate analysis showed that early signs of a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries were most strongly related to breast arterial calcification while cac was about two times as likely with advancing age or high blood pressure it was three times more likely with breast arterial calcification the message is if a woman is getting a mammogram look for breast arterial calcification its a freebie and provides critical information that could be lifesaving for some women hecht said adding he hopes these findings will prompt clinicians who rarely report breast arterial calcification to routinely report not just the presence or absence of breast arterial calcifications but also to estimate and note the amount the more breast arterial calcification a women has the more likely she is to have calcium in her hearts arteries as well if all it requires is to take a closer look at the images how can we ignore it he said a total of 292 women who had digital mammography and noncontrast ct scans within one year were included in the study of these 124 or 425 percent were found to have evidence of breast arterial calcification mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the cac results women with breast arterial calcification were more likely to be older have high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease and less likely smokers women with established cardiovascular diseases were excluded breast arterial calcification was evaluated on a scale from zero to 12 by increasing severity and cac was measured on the ct using a validated 012 severity score the overall accuracy of breast arterial calcification for the presence of cac was 70 percent and 63 percent of those with cac also had breast arterial calcification to date there is no consensus on using cac as a screening test though a very large outcome study of 39000 subjects is underway in the netherlands mammography however is widely used and accepted and as hecht said may provide an opportunity to risk stratify asymptomatic women by breast arterial calcification who might have calcium in the coronary arteries and ordinarily would not have been readily considered for cardiovascular screening heart disease is the leading cause of death among women yet breast cancer is often the most feared roughly 37 million mammograms are performed annually in the us mammography is recommended annually for women over 40 years of age by the american cancer society and every other year for women 5075 years old and women at high risk for breast cancer by the us preventive service task force digital mammography is more sensitive to the presence of calcifications and is now available in 96 percent of mammography units in the us another intriguing point that deserves additional study according to the researchers is that the nature of the atherosclerosis is different in breast arterial calcification and cac making it unclear why one should be related to the other hecht stresses that these findings warrant further evaluation and validation in larger studies future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be because the study involved women who received both mammography and ct scan for clinical indications these women may have been more likely than the average woman to have coexisting conditions although hecht said these were unrelated to heart disease this study is being published simultaneously online in jacc cardiovascular imaging in an accompanying editorial in jacc cardiovascular imaging khurram nasir md mph and john mcevoy from the center for healthcare advancement and outcomes at baptist health south florida said that the report provides impetus to document breast arterial calcification in mammography reports to improve education of primary care and radiology providers on the link with heart disease and other actions to establish best practices for incorporating this research into care even by the conservative estimate of 10 percent approximately 4 million women nationwide undergoing screening mammography will exhibit breast arterial calcification with 2 to 3 million of them likely to have signs of premature coronary atherosclerotic disease the authors said whether the best use of breast arterial calcification is to trigger additional testing or to directly inform preventive treatment decisions either by flagging highrisk women to their providers or by reclassifying traditional heart disease risk estimates is worth further discussion
real,ewing nj march 14 2016 prnewswire celator pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq cpxx today announced positive results from the phase 3 trial of vyxeos cytarabine daunorubicin liposome for injection also known as cpx351 in patients with highrisk secondary acute myeloid leukemia aml compared to the standard of care regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin known as 73 the trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival data will be submitted for presentation at the american society of clinical oncology 2016 annual meeting the median overall survival for patients treated with vyxeos in the study was 956 months compared to 595 months for patients receiving 73 representing a 361 month improvement in favor of vyxeos the hazard ratio hr was 069 p0005 which represents a 31 percent reduction in the risk of death versus 73 the percentage of patients alive 12 months after randomization was 415 on the vyxeos arm compared to 276 on the 73 arm the percentage of patients alive 24 months after randomization was 311 on the vyxeos arm compared to 123 on the 73 arm the overall survival advantage seen with cpx351 compared to 73 along with a superior response rate and no increase in serious toxicity indicates that well likely have a new standard of care for treating older patients with secondary aml said jeffrey e lancet md senior member and chief of the leukemiamyelodysplasia program at moffitt cancer center and the principal investigator for the study this represents a major step forward for a very difficulttotreat patient population vyxeos also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in induction response rate crcri of 477 versus 333 p0016 and this significance was maintained for the analysis of cr alone cr of 373 versus 256 p0040 sixtyday allcause mortality was 137 versus 212 in favor of patients treated with vyxeos no substantial difference in grade 3 or higher adverse events was observed between vyxeos and 73 in the intenttotreat population grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse events were similar for overall infections febrile neutropenia and bleeding events in the intenttotreat population grade 3 or higher nonhematologic adverse events were similar across all organ systems including cardiac gastrointestinal general systems metabolic disorders musculoskeletal nervous system respiratory skin and renal these findings confirm that vyxeos provides the first opportunity weve had in decades to extend survival for patients with highrisk aml added gail roboz md professor of medicine and director of the leukemia program at the weill medical college of cornell university and the new yorkpresbyterian hospital in new york also more patients in remission means more who are eligible for potentially curative therapy based on these results the company expects to submit a new drug application nda for vyxeos with the us food and drug administration fda later this year and submit a marketing authorization application maa with the european medicines agency ema in the first quarter of 2017 the successful outcome of this phase 3 trial represents an important advance for aml patients their families and clinicians said scott jackson chief executive officer of celator pharmaceuticals it also marks a major milestone for celator for vyxeos and for our combiplex platform we offer our sincere thanks to the patients and investigators who participated in this study and we will work closely with regulatory authorities to make this new treatment available to the aml community as soon as possible the clinical trial was conducted in partnership with the leukemia lymphoma society lls through its therapy acceleration program tap which has supported the clinical development of

characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature blast cells in the bone marrow aml is generally a disease of older adults and the median age of a patient diagnosed with aml is about 67 years the american cancer society estimates that there will be 19950 new cases of aml and 10430 deaths from aml in the us in 2016 in europe the number of new cases is estimated to be 18000 and in japan the number is 5500 the company estimates that nearly 70 percent of aml patients are over the age of 60 and approximately 75 percent are intermediate or high risk furthermore approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment even with current treatment overall survival for aml is poor in patients over 60 years of age the 5 year survival rate is less than 10

real,a combination of two drugs delays progression of advanced aggressive breast cancer by an average of nine months working in all subsets of the most common type of breast cancer the combination of a firstinclass targeted drug called palbociclib and the hormone drug fulvestrant slowed cancer growth in around two thirds of women with advanced forms of the most common type of breast cancer the combination allowed many women with metastatic hormonereceptorpositive her2negative cancer to delay the start of chemotherapy which is the traditional treatment option in these patients once hormone drugs have stopped working the international study led in the uk by dr nicholas turner from the institute of cancer research london and the royal marsden nhs foundation trust updates the results of a major phase iii trial published last year the results confirm the prior benefit observed with palbociclib and show that palbociclib works regardless of how sensitive patients cancer was to earlier hormone therapy the new research published today thursday in the lancet oncology shows that even women with specific genetic changes conveying resistance to hormone therapy can benefit from the new drug combination hormonereceptorpositive her2negative cancer accounts for around 75 per cent of cases of breast cancer in the trial researchers from 144 research centres in 17 countries followed 521 women allocated to receive either palbociclib and fulvestrant or a dummy pill and fulvestrant the trial was funded by pfizer women in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group took a median of 95 months to progress as measured by ct and mri scans compared with 46 months in the placebo group some 67 per cent of the 347 women in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group showed clinical benefit either a reduction in tumour size or control of disease for at least six months compared with 40 per cent of the 174 women in the placebo plus fulvestrant group some 19 per cent in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group had a decrease in tumour size compared with 9 per cent in the placebo plus fulvestrant group the study also aimed to assess whether cancers with particular genetic traits responded less well or better to the combination than others mutations to the gene pik3ca represent the most common genetic event in breast cancer and mutations in the gene are associated with a shorter response to hormone therapy the research showed that using liquid biopsies that measure cancer dna circulating in the blood to detect pik3ca and tests for blood hormone levels the palbociclib combination worked in all types of hormonereceptor positive her2 negative breast cancer palbociclib is a firstinclass drug with a different mechanism of action to other approved drugs which simultaneously blocks two proteins called cdk4 and cdk6 in cancer cells it causes less severe sideeffects than traditional chemotherapy in the trial severe sideeffects caused by the combination were rare many women 81 per cent on the palbociclib arm had a drop in their white blood cell count but this rarely led to serious symptoms study colead author dr nicolas turner team leader in molecular oncology at the institute of cancer research london and consultant medical oncologist at the royal marsden nhs foundation trust said our research underlines the effectiveness of palbociclib with fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer and importantly demonstrates its benefit in all types of hormonereceptor positive breast cancer we hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months our study also sends a powerful message that in combining new drugs in innovative trials we can find better options for women with advanced breast cancer chemotherapy can add several months to life but it comes at a cost of often lifelimiting side effects and we need alternative treatments that are better tolerated to treat patients with advanced breast cancer professor paul workman chief executive of the institute of cancer research london said if were going to drive further improvements in survival from cancer its essential that we find ways of prolonging life in people whose cancers have evolved and become resistant to treatment this trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancers escape routes its very encouraging to see such substantial delays to cancer progression
real,neurosurgeons at barrow neurological institute in phoenix are involved with testing the viability of deep brain stimulation dbs to treat alzheimers disease a disorder that currently has few treatment options results from the phase 2 study reported in the journal of neurosurgery on dec 18 2015 demonstrated the safety of dbs in alzheimers patients a neurosurgical procedure in which an implanted neurostimulator delivers electrical signals to specific areas of the brain to help regulate abnormal signals dbs is currently only approved in the us for the treatment of parkinsons disease and essential tremor however its use is being researched for a number of conditions including epilepsy depression and bipolar disorder francisco ponce md director of the barrow center for neuromodulation believes there are potential applications for alzheimers disease the most common form of dementia as well whereas in parkinsons disease and essential tremor the target for the electrodes are nodes within the motor circuits the alzheimers study targeted the fornix which is part of the memory pathway there are more than five million americans living with alzheimers and yet there are few promising pharmacologic treatment options for this progressive disease says dr ponce previous pilot studies researching the use of dbs in alzheimers have indicated the potential to slow cognitive decline in some patients and have even shown metabolic changes in the brain that may slow the progression of the disease barrow neurological institute is part of dignity health st josephs hospital in phoenix the advance trial using a device from functional neuromodulation inc is aimed at evaluating the safety efficacy and tolerability of dbs in this patient population initial research took place between 2012 and 2014 at six hospitals throughout the us including banner alzheimers institute in phoenix and banner sun health research institute in sun city as well as one institution in canada during the trial 42 patients with mild alzheimers disease underwent the surgical procedure and were closely monitored for adverse effects overall there were no programmingrelated adverse effects unanticipated adverse device effects reported neurological deficits or instances of mortality in the study population adverse effects such as headache and infection occurred in 119 5 of 42 of the patients in this study consistent with rates reported in other dbs trials the first phase of this study was designed to evaluate the 90day postoperative safety of this particular surgical method while the study was relatively small we believe the data suggest that dbs surgery targeting the fornix can be performed safely in this patient population the hope is that our positive surgical experience will help pave the way for future research into dbs and alzheimers says dr ponce dr ponce adds that the next step is evaluating the efficacy and longerterm safety of the treatment which will not be known until the last patient completes the twoyear evaluation later this year
real,eylea outperforms avastin for diabetic macular edema with moderate or worse vision loss nihfunded clinical trial shows eylea avastin and lucentis perform similarly when vision loss is mild national eye institute a twoyear clinical trial that compared three drugs for diabetic macular edema dme found that gains in vision were greater for participants receiving the drug eylea aflibercept than for those receiving avastin bevacizumab but only among participants starting treatment with 2050 or worse vision gains after two years were about the same for eylea and lucentis ranibizumab contrary to yearone results from the study which showed eylea with a clear advantage the three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 2032 or 2040 vision at the start of treatment the clinical trial was conducted by the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network drcrnet which is funded by the national eye institute part of the national institutes of health this rigorous trial confirms that eylea avastin and lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema said nei director paul a sieving md phd eye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs eylea avastin and lucentis are all widely used to treat dme a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina the macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead the drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor vegf a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage although the drugs have a similar mode of action they differ significantly in cost based on medicare allowable charges the perinjection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about 1850 for eylea about 60 for avastin and about 1200 for lucentis drcrnet investigators enrolled 660 people with dme at 89 clinical trial sites across the united states when the study began participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes only people with a visual acuity of 2032 or worse were eligible to participate to see clearly a person with 2032 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet at enrollment about half the participants had 2032 to 2040 vision the other half had 2050 or worse vision in many states a corrected visual acuity of 2040 or better in at least one eye is required for a drivers license that allows both day and nighttime driving each participant was assigned randomly to receive eylea 20 milligrams005 milliliter avastin 125 mg005 ml or lucentis 03 mg005 ml participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 416 weeks during the second year most participants received monthly injections during the first six months thereafter participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until dme resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement subsequently injections were resumed if dme worsened additionally laser treatment was given if dme persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for dme until widespread adoption of antivegf drugs a few years ago among participants with 2040 or better vision at the trials start all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart on average participants vision improved from 2040 vision to 2025 among participants with 2050 or worse vision at the trials start visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups at two years eylea participants were able to read about 35 additional lines on an eye chart lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines and avastin participants improved about 25 lines compared with visual acuity before treatment eylea outperformed avastin at the one and twoyear time points while eylea outperformed lucentis at the oneyear time point by the twoyear time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different at the end of the trial average visual acuity was 2032 to 2040 among participants in all three groups the results of the drcr networks comparison of eylea avastin and lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy said john a wells md the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the palmetto retina center columbia south carolina the study suggests there is little advantage of choosing eylea or lucentis over avastin when a patients loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild meaning a visual acuity of 2040 or better however patients with 2050 or worse vision loss may benefit from eylea which over the course of the twoyear study outperformed lucentis and avastin the number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups eylea avastin and lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year the need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups by two years 41 percent of participants in the eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema compared with 64 percent of participants in the avastin group and 52 percent in the lucentis group the risk of heart attack stroke or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the lucentis group twelve percent of lucentis participants had at least one event compared with five percent of participants in the eylea group and eight percent of participants in the avastin group this difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies and therefore may be due to chance continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes the occurrence of eye complications such as eye infections and inflammation was similar for all three drugs results of the study were published online today in ophthalmology the journal of the american academy of ophthalmology eylea and lucentis were provided by drug

real,newswise omega3 fatty acids may lower the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal obese women according to researchers the protection likely comes from the fatty acids antiinflammatory effects said dr andrea manni professor and division chief of endocrinology diabetes and metabolism penn state college of medicine obesity is a major breast cancer risk factor in postmenopausal women and scientists believe increased inflammation is an important underlying cause in this population omega3 fatty acids have an antiinflammatory effect so thats one of the reasons why we suspected it may be particularly effective in obese women manni said some epidemiological data supports the idea that omega3s protect against breast cancer but the findings have been inconsistent manni suspected that data from normalweight women obscured the results normalweight women have less inflammation than heavier women and are therefore less likely to benefit from antiinflammatory omega3s he said to tease apart the effects mannis team working alongside researchers from emory university and colorado state university looked at the influence of prescription omega3 supplementation on breast density in different weight women breast density is a wellestablished biomarker for breast cancer risk and may be an independent risk factor as well the higher the breast density the more likely the woman will develop breast cancer manni said the study included 266 healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density detected by routine mammograms the women either received no treatment the antiestrogen drug raloxifene the prescription omega3 drug lovaza or a combination of the two drugs at the conclusion of the twoyear study the researchers found that increasing levels of omega3 in the blood were associated with reduced breast densitybut only in women with a body mass index above 29 bordering on obesity although lovaza contains both of the fatty acids dha 375 milligrams and epa 465 milligrams only dha blood levels were associated with breast density reduction the researchers plan to test the effect of dha alone in obese subjects potentially in combination with weight loss in a future trial the finding supports the idea that omega3s and specifically dha are preferentially protective in obese postmenopausal women manni said this represents an example of a personalized approach to breast cancer prevention these findings may help to support future research looking at the direct effect of omega3 supplementation on breast cancer incidence in obese women manni added that with obesityrelated cancers on the rise the findings could have implications beyond breast cancer the researchers also made a secondary discovery lovaza is an omega3 drug fdaapproved for the treatment of severe high triglycerides at the dose of 4 milligrams daily in the current study the combination of lovaza and a half recommended dose of raloxifene at 30 milligrams was superior to the individual treatments in reducing triglycerides and ldl bad cholesterol and increasing hdl good cholesterol other investigators on this project were narinder sandhu and carina signori department of medicine susann e schetter department of radiology jason liao and ana calcagnotto department of public health sciences john p richie bogdan prokopczyk and neil trushin department of pharmacology cynthia dubrock penn state hershey cancer institute christopher hamilton and laurence m demers department of pathology cesar aliaga and karam elbayoumy department of biochemistry and molecular biology all at penn state milton s hershey medical center terryl j hartman emory university and john mcginley and henry j thompson colorado state universitysusan g komen for the cure and penn state hershey cancer institute funded this research glaxosmith kline and eli lilly supplied lovaza and raloxifene respectively about penn state college of medicinelocated on the campus of penn state milton s hershey medical center in hershey pa penn state college of medicine boasts a portfolio of nearly 82 million in funded research projects range from the development of artificial organs and advanced diagnostics to groundbreaking cancer treatments and understanding the fundamental causes of disease enrolling its first students in 1967 the college of medicine has more than 1600 students and trainees in medicine nursing the health professions and biomedical research on its campus omega3 fatty acids may lower breast cancer risk in postmenopausal obese women
real,despite several safe drug therapies available to help smokers quit threequarters report relapsing within six months of a quit attempt university of pennsylvania researchers rebecca ashare and heath schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of fdaapproved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from alzheimers disease in a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial ashare and schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or acheis called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake the rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an achei decreased their nicotine consumption consistent with these effects clinical trial participants taking the achei not the placebo smoked 23 fewer cigarettes daily a 12 percent decrease and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke were very interested in screening potential efficacy of antiaddiction medications in our models said schmidt a professor in penns school of nursing and perelman school of medicine for this study we looked at potential smokingcessation medications the research itself took a translational approach what ashare a professor in penn medicines psychiatry department calls bidirectional in other words the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa at penns center for interdisciplinary research on nicotine addiction work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001 specifically research from caryn lerman cirnas director and the mary w calkins professor in psychiatry concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in whats commonly called their executive functions they feel fuzzy theyre forgetful ashare said those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking it was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further thats when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the brain the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and shortterm memory when nicotine enters the body it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to resulting in smokings rewarding and reinforcement effects acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and in effect substitute nicotines effects schmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine he divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts to mirror voluntary drug taking in humans the rats selfadministered nicotine using a lever pushed at will once nicotinetaking stabilized the rats were pretreated with one of the two acheis for both drugs we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine selfadministered schmidt said however there was a caveat we know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting when taking these drugs and this will limit their compliance he said we had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine selfadministration but we wanted to make sure it wasnt because the rats were sick unlike humans who can verbally report when they dont feel well and whose bodies react to nausea rats lack the reflex to vomit in previous research matthew hayes who has appointments in penn medicine and penn nursing had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects collaborating with hayes schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the acheis at the doses shown to reduce nicotine selfadministration the acheis did not make our animals sick schmidt said the findings sparked the cirna clinical trial which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60 people who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days for the first two weeks they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo before the trial began researchers assessed the smokers cognitive function to get a baseline participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day two more assessments took place after the two weeks on the cigarettedrug combination and again after that initial smokefree day finally the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo that weeklong period is a proxy for longerterm cessation the ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of longterm success ashare said shes still actively recruiting for the trial with an aim of 80 people total once the trial reaches that number shell dig into overall quit data what shes learned so far that smokers who used the fdaapproved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less is promising particularly given that those who dont smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available she said we know that theyre effective our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits theres no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these acheis now but ashare and schmidt are forging a path and if it leads where they think it might it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit ashare and schmidt published their work in the nature journal translational psychiatry

real,the use of proton radiotherapy to treat the most common malignant brain tumor in children is as effective as standard photon xray radiation therapy while causing fewer longterm side effects such as hearing loss and cognitive disorders according to a study receiving online publication in lancet oncology the paper from a team led by massachusetts general hospital mgh investigators describes patient outcomes an average of seven years after proton therapy for medulloblastoma a fastgrowing tumor that develops in the cerebellum at the base of the brain proton radiotherapy is still not widely available in the us or around the world but it is increasingly recognized for its potential to reduce the side effects of treatment particularly in the pediatric population says torunn yock md mch mgh department of radiation oncology lead and corresponding author of the report at experienced centers proton therapy has a proven track record of treatment success and safety in contrast to photon radiotherapy in which a dose of radiation is delivered all along the xray beam as it passes through a patients body in proton therapy the dose is precisely focused on the target area with little or no dose delivered to normal tissues in front of or behind the tumor this feature has made proton therapy particularly attractive to treat tumors in or near the brain or eyes areas where the protection of nearby healthy tissues is particularly critical while medulloblastoma can often be successfully treated with a combination of surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy because of its location within the brain longterm side effects are common these can include hearing loss which can be particularly problematic in young children problems with learning and memory and neuroendocrine disorders caused by irradiation of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus also commonly seen are problems affecting the heart lungs thyroid spine and reproductive organs all of which tend to be more serious in children treated at younger ages while proton therapy may appear to be ideal for reducing these adverse effects no previous study had prospectively examined the longterm results of children treated for medulloblastoma with proton therapy to investigate their hypothesis that proton therapy would reduce the incidence and severity of side effects without loss of treatment effectiveness the researchers enrolled children and adolescents ages 3 to 21 with an average age of around 6 who received proton therapy for medulloblastoma at the mgh from 2003 to 2009 all had previous surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible and all received chemotherapy before during or after proton therapy study participants were tested for hearing a variety of cognitive functions levels of important hormones and height and weight at the outset of the study and at several followup visits for up to eight years of 59 patients who enrolled 12 died from their tumor during the study period and one from a traumatic brain injury significant hearing loss was seen in 12 percent of patients three years after treatment and in 16 percent at five years which compares with around 25 percent reported in studies using photon radiotherapy the cognitive effects of proton therapy primarily affecting verbal comprehension and processing speed were also less serious than what has been reported with photon radiotherapy and those effects were primarily seen in children who were under the age of 8 when treated the neuroendocrine effects of proton therapy deficits in any hormone level were seen in 63 percent of participants seven years after treatment were similar to what has been reported with photon therapy however no cardiac pulmonary gastrointestinal seizure or secondary tumor effects all of which have been reported in photon therapy studies were seen in the current studys participants survival rates and the incidence and type of tumor recurrence all were similar to what has been reported for photon radiotherapy our results indicate that proton therapy maintains excellent cure rates in pediatric medulloblastoma while reducing longterm side effects particularly in hearing and neurocognitive function and eliminating cardiac pulmonary gastrointestinal and reproductive effects says yock who is an associate professor of radiation oncology at harvard medical school while we are currently investigating quality of life differences between proton and photon treatment i truly believe that particularly for the youngest children the ability to offer them proton therapy can make a big difference in their lives

real,targeted magnetic pulses to the brain were shown to reduce craving and substance use in cocaineaddicted patients the results of this pilot study published in the peerreviewed journal european neuropsychopharmacology suggest that this may become an effective medical treatment for patients with cocaine addiction although a larger trial is needed to confirm the initial findings cocaine use is widespread in the western world last year 23 million young europeans aged 15 to 34 used cocaine and the us national institute on drug abuse estimates that 14 million americans suffer from cocaine addiction1 there is no effective drug treatment for cocaine addiction with behavioural therapies being the main element of any treatment regime now a group of researchers working in italy and the usa have shown in a preliminary clinical study that cocaine use can be reduced by treatment with rtms repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as author dr antonello bonci scientific director national institute on drug abuse and adjunct professor john hopkins university baltimore said despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2 there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition the practical work was conducted by team of scientists led by dr luigi gallimberti from the university of padova medical school italy who enrolled 32 patients who were seeking treatment for cocaine addiction at the hospital clinic the participating patients were randomized to receive either rtms or standard symptomrelieving medications the experimental group received one rtms session per day for five days and then once a week for the following three weeks for a total of 8 tms sessions over 29 days those in the control group received pharmacological treatment for symptoms associated with cocaine addiction such as depression anxiety and sleep problems the study indicated the safety of rtms in patients with cocaine addiction there was significantly less craving and there were a significantly higher number of cocainefree urine drug tests in the rtms compared to the control group in addition 69 1116 patients in the experimental group showed no relapse to cocaine use whereas only 19 316 patients in the control group showed a similar positive result the results are adjusted for patients who dropped out of the trial dr bonci said rtms is a noninvasive and very safe therapeutic approach which is used with other mental health and neurological conditions such as depression and neuropathic pain our study suggests that rtms may also represent a new treatment for patients with cocaine use disorder at the end of the first 29 days of the experiment the experimental group was given the option of continuing the treatment whereas those in the control group were given the possibility of receiving the same rtms treatment as the experimental group for 63 days results further confirmed the beneficial effects of rtms in helping patients to maintain abstinence from cocaine dr bonci continued we consider this study promising but preliminary we need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using shamtms as the control condition as far as we know this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rtms treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use it is also important to emphasize that in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting the group studied albeit small was a real world sample we have continued to follow patients from the trial and the improvement seems to be sustained over time up to 12 months although we dont have any hard data on that yet it is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial we decided to target an area of the brain involved in decision making the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dl pfc this was because previous animal studies from our lab had shown that compulsive cocaineseeking was associated with hypoactivity in the prelimbic cortex which is a brain area that shares similar behavioural roles to the dl pfc importantly we had found that increasing the activity in the prelimbic cortex could significantly reduce cocaine selfadministration commenting european neuropsychopharmacology editor dr andreas meyerlindenberg mannheim said this study represents a creative approach to a disorder that is notoriously difficult to treat in the real world these pilot data also show that biological treatments nowadays reach far beyond medications and that new neuroscience methods may be used for targeted changes in brain regions relevant for complex mental disorders

real,cognitive behavioural therapy could help many people with a dental phobia overcome their fear of visiting the dentist and enable them to receive dental treatment without the need to be sedated according to a new study by kings college london anxiety about visiting the dentist is common and becomes a phobia when it has a marked impact on someones wellbeing people with dental phobias typically avoid going to the dentist and end up experiencing more dental pain poorer oral health and a detrimental effect on their quality of life estimates from the most recent adult dental health survey in the uk suggest around one in ten people suffers from dental phobia cognitive behavioural therapy cbt is a shortterm therapy typically lasting 610 sessions cbt has been shown to help with a range of psychological problems most notably for depression and anxietyrelated disorders both cognitive and behavioural interventions have been shown to be successful in reducing dental anxiety and increasing dental attendance the latest study published in the british dental journal looked at the characteristics of 130 patients 99 women and 31 men attending a psychologistled cbt service and the outcomes of their treatment patients attending a clinic run by the kings college london dental institute health psychology service at guys and st thomas nhs foundation trust were surveyed for their levels of dental anxiety general anxiety depression suicidal thoughts alcohol use and oral healthrelated quality of life threequarters of those assessed scored 19 or higher on the modified dental anxiety scale mdas indicating dental phobia the remainder all scored high on one or more items of the mdas suggesting a specific fear of some aspect of dentistry fear of dental injections and the dental drill were the most common high scoring items on the mdas nearly all patients 94 reported a knockon effect from problems with their teeth mouth or gums on their daily living and quality of life a proportion of the patients surveyed were found to have other psychological conditions 37 had high levels of general anxiety and 12 had clinically significant levels of depression suicidal thoughts were reported by 12 of patients and four 3 reported a recent intent to commit suicide individuals were referred to support services via the care of their gp and for suicide risk immediate action was taken based on local service guidelines of all patients referred fourfifths 79 went on to have dental treatment without the need for sedation and 6 had their dental treatment under sedation the average number of cbt appointments required before a patient received dental treatment without sedation was five professor tim newton from the dental institute at kings college london and lead author of the study said people with dental phobia are most commonly given sedation to allow them to become relaxed enough for a short period of time to have their dental treatment performed however this does not help them to overcome their fear in the long term the primary goal of our cbt service is to enable patients to receive dental treatment without the need for sedation by working with each individual patient to set goals according to their priorities our study shows that after on average five cbt sessions most people can go on to be treated by the dentist without the need to be sedated however there is a need for people with dental phobia to be carefully assessed by trained cbt practitioners working with dental health professionals some of the patients referred to us were found to be experiencing additional psychological difficulties and needed further referral and management cbt provides a way of reducing the need for sedation in people with a phobia but there will still be those who need sedation because they require urgent dental treatment or they are having particularly invasive treatments our service should be viewed as complementing sedation services rather than as an alternative the two together providing a comprehensive care pathway for the ultimate benefit of patients a recent study published in the same journal coauthored by professor tim newton showed that more women than men reported dental phobia in the 2009 adult dental health survey those with dental phobia were more likely to come from a lower income background have more caries in their teeth and suffer from poorer oral health overall
real,oak brook ill additional breast cancers found with mri are sometimes larger and potentially more aggressive than those found on mammography according to a study published online in the journal radiology researchers said that in some cases mri findings of additional cancers not seen on mammography may necessitate a change in treatment breast mri is the most sensitive technique for the detection of breast cancer with widespread application in the screening of highrisk patients and presurgical planning in younger women and women with dense breasts mri is effective in the detection of what are known as multicentric cancers meaning breast cancers involving two or more distinct primary tumors usually in different quadrants of the breast however there has been some debate about the clinical significance of multicentric cancers found with mri patients with clinically insignificant cancers undergoing potential overtreatment versus patients who may be undertreated is at the heart of the controversy surrounding breast mri said the studys lead author chiara iacconi md from the breast unit at usl1 massacarrara in carrara italy to learn more dr iacconi and colleagues reviewed records from 2021 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer who underwent biopsy after preoperative mri of the 2021 patients 285 or 14 percent had additional cancer detected on mri that was hidden from view on mammography in 73 of those 285 patients or 256 percent mri identified at least one additional cancer in a different quadrant of the breast than the index cancer or the cancer detected by mammography andor breast palpation these multicentric cancers were larger than the known index cancer in 17 of the 73 patients or 233 percent in addition the mridetected multicentric cancers were greater than 1 centimeter in size in 25 percent of the 73 patients we believe invasive cancer larger than 1 centimeter is clinically relevant disease dr iacconi said in general it is accepted that radiation can likely treat invasive cancer less than 1 centimeter but lesions larger than 1 centimeter especially invasive carcinomas may not be reliably treated with conservation the additional mridetected multicentric cancers were found mostly in patients with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts however mri also detected additional disease in 19 percent of patients with fatty or scattered fibroglandular tissue the results show that multicentric cancer detected on breast mri after mammography appears to represent a larger tumor burden in approximately a quarter of patients and can result in potential changes to cancer grade and treatment dr iacconi said
real,older adults who take college courses may increase their cognitive capacity and possibly reduce their risk for developing alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia according to new research published by the american psychological association an australian study called the tasmanian healthy brain project recruited 359 participants ages 50 to 79 who took a series of cognitive tests before completing at least a year of fulltime or parttime study at the university of tasmania participants were reassessed annually for three years following their studies more than 90 percent of the participants displayed a significant increase in cognitive capacity compared with 56 percent in a control group of 100 participants who didnt take any college courses the study findings are exciting because they demonstrate that its never too late to take action to maximize the cognitive capacity of your brain said lead researcher megan lenehan phd we plan to follow these participants as they age to see if college studies could help delay the onset or reduce the debilitating effects of dementia previous studies have examined how exercise brain games and an active social life may boost cognitive capacity and possibly stem cognitive decline associated with aging this study is the first to examine similar positive effects from college courses taken by older adults said lenehan of the university of tasmania the study participants who were screened to exclude people who had dementia completed a baseline series of tests to measure cognitive capacity or an individuals ability to use brain networks efficiently in areas such as memory information processing decision making and planning the participants in the college studies group took a wide range of courses including history psychology philosophy and fine art most of the students took courses on campus but some completed online classes the researchers suspect that campus study may provide greater benefits in boosting cognitive capacity because of social interaction with professors and fellow students but the study didnt analyze any differences between oncampus or online courses the participants completed the same cognitive tests each year during the fouryear study with 92 percent of the collegestudies group displaying a significant increase in cognitive capacity while the remaining 8 percent generally maintained their cognitive capacity for the control group 56 percent displayed a significant increase in cognitive capacity while 44 percent had no change the participants age gender feelings of wellbeing or level of social connectedness didnt affect the findings the research was published online in the journal neuropsychology prior research has shown that college study earlier in life may increase cognitive capacity and it appears the same may be true for older adults lenehan said it is possible that any mentally stimulating activity later in life may also enhance cognitive capacity such as other adulteducation classes or programs to increase social interaction she said the control group was significantly older than the college studies group but there were no significant differences in baseline cognitive capacity scores the study noted the researchers also didnt find any correlation between age and cognitive capacity scores at any point during the study some participants in the control group may have been doing crossword puzzles or other mentally stimulating activities that boosted their cognitive capacity lenehan said the participants who took college classes volunteered for the study so they probably had a greater interest in continuing education that the general senior population the journal article noted the study was too short to reveal any longterm effects so the researchers plan to follow the participants as they age to provide additional evidence of whether college studies may reduce the risk or delay the onset of dementia

real,a study that tracked tens of thousands of midlife and older men for more than 20 years has found that vigorous exercise and other healthy lifestyle habits may cut their chances of developing a lethal type of prostate cancer by up to 68 percent while most prostate cancers are clinically indolent meaning they do not metastasize and are nonlifethreatening a minority of patients are diagnosed with aggressive disease that invades the bone and other organs and is ultimately fatal lead author stacey kenfield scd of ucsf and a team of researchers at ucsf and harvard focused on this variant of prostate cancer to determine if exercise diet and smokefree status might have lifesaving benefits in the study published today nov 17 2015 in the journal of the national cancer institute the researchers analyzed data from two us studies the health professionals followup study that tracked more than 42000 males ages 40 to 75 from 1986 to 2010 and a second the physicians health study that followed more than 20000 males ages 40 to 84 from 1982 to 2010 to gage the effects of lifestyle habits the researchers developed a score based on the results of the health professionals survey then applied it to the physicians study they assigned one point for each affirmative response to questions about regular intense exercise that induced sweating body mass index bmi under 30 tobaccofree status for a minimum of 10 years high intake of fatty fish high intake of tomatoes and low intake of processed meat to reduce error participants had to be free of diagnosed cancer at the start of the study and a fouryear lag was imposed to rule out those who unknowingly had lethal prostate cancer which was determined by evidence of prostate cancer death or metastasis to the bones or other organs excluding the lymph nodes cases were confirmed through medical records and pathology reports and cause of death was determined by death certificate and medical record and secondarily by next of kin vigorous activity trumps other lifestyle factors the researchers identified 576 cases of lethal prostate cancer in the health professionals group and 337 cases in the physicians group participants with 5 to 6 points in the health professionals group had a 68 percent decreased risk of lethal prostate cancer and a 38 percent decreased risk was observed in the physicians group for the same comparison for dietary factors alone men with three points versus those with zero points had a 46 percent decreased chance of developing lethal prostate cancer in the health professionals group in the physicians group this decrease was 30 percent while there were fewer cases and less detailed data collected in the physicians study the score was similar in both populations indicating the potential benefit of healthy lifestyle habits in warding off lethal prostate cancer said the authors we estimated that 47 percent of lethal prostate cancer cases would be prevented in the united states if men over 60 had five or more of these healthy habits said kenfield assistant professor in the department of urology at ucsf medical center and formerly of the department of medicine at harvard medical school in boston where the study was initiated its interesting that vigorous activity had the highest potential impact on prevention of lethal prostate cancer we calculated the populationattributable risk for american men over 60 and estimated that 34 percent of lethal prostate cancer would be reduced if all men exercised to the point of sweating for at least three hours a week kenfield said the researchers also calculated that lethal prostate cancer among american men over 60 would be cut by 15 percent if they consumed at least seven servings of tomatoes per week and that 17 percent would be spared this diagnosis if they consumed at least one serving of fatty fish per week reducing intake of processed meats would cut the risk by 12 percent they reported in contrast the populationattributed risk for smoking was 3 percent largely because the majority of older american men are longterm nonsmokers lifestyle changes also prevent heart disease diabetes this study underscores the ongoing need for more effective prevention measures and policies to increase exercise improve diet quality and reduce tobacco use in our population said senior author june m chan scd from the departments of urology and epidemiology and biostatistics at ucsf it takes cooperation and effort from multiple areas like insurance companies employers policy makers and city planners to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults working day these lifestyle habits align with other recommendations to prevent diabetes and heart disease about one man in seven will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime making it the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the united states excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer according to the american cancer society in 2015 there will be approximately 220800 cases of prostate cancer and approximately 27 540 deaths
real,newswise boston november 13 2015 a clinical trial among more than 300 patients has found that the drug ranibizumab lucentis is highly effective in treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy pdr a complication of diabetes that can severely damage eyesight the results published by the journal of the american medical association demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years funded by the national eye institute nei and conducted by the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network drcrnet the trial compared lucentis injections with a type of laser therapy called panretinal photocoagulation which has remained the gold standard for pdr since the mid1970s although laser therapy preserves central vision it can damage night and side vision so researchers have sought therapies that lack these side effects the trial results provide crucial evidence for a safe and effective alternative to laser therapy against pdr said nei director paul a sieving md phd patients who received lucentis showed a little bit better central vision much less loss of their side vision and substantially less risk for surgery than patients who received laser treatment said lloyd paul aiello md phd director of the beetham eye institute at joslin diabetes center and professor of ophthalmology at harvard medical school these findings will change the available treatment options for patients with pdr diabetic retinopathy damages blood vessels in the lightsensitive retina in the back of the eye as the disease worsens blood vessels can swell and lose their ability to function properly diabetic retinopathy becomes proliferative when lack of blood flow in the retina increases production of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor vegf which can stimulate the growth of new abnormal blood vessels these new vessels are prone to bleeding into the center of the eye sometimes requiring a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy to clear the blood the abnormal blood vessels can also cause scarring and retinal detachment untreated pdr is associated with high risk of visual loss lucentis is among several drugs that block the effects of vegf dr aiello and george king md chief scientific officer at joslin diabetes center and professor of medicine at harvard medical school pioneered the study of vegf in diabetic eye disease beginning in the early 1990s their work followed a distinguished joslin traditionthe basic laser photocoagulation technique was developed in the 1960s by dr aiellos father lloyd m aiello md and grandfather william p beetham md about 77 million us residents have diabetic retinopathy a leading cause of blindness among workingage americans among these about 15 percent have progressed to pdr the drcrnet enrolled 305 participants 394 eyes with pdr in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country eyes were assigned randomly to treatment with lucentis or laser about half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment in the other group lucentis was injected into the eye once per month for three consecutive months and then as needed until the disease resolved or stabilized because lucentis is commonly injected to treat diabetic macular edema dmea buildup of fluid in the center of the retinathe study permitted the use of lucentis for dme in the laser group if necessary slightly more than half 53 percent of eyes in the laser group received lucentis injections to treat dme about 6 percent of eyes in the lucentis group received laser therapy mostly for issues other than dme at two years vision in the lucentis group improved by an average of about half a line on an eye chart compared with virtually no change in the laser group participants treated with laser generally lost substantial peripheral vision but those given injections did not emphasized jennifer sun md mph associate professor of ophthalmology at harvard medical school and physician at the beetham eye institute this was a clear benefit associated with the antivegf medication said dr sun who as the drcrnet nationwide protocol working investigator was instrumental in the studys development many of our patients who have laser treatment notice that they have more tunnel vision which can lead to difficulties as they go about activities of daily life the use of antivegf treatment rather than laser for pdr could help prevent these symptoms additionally the need for vitrectomy surgery was lower in the lucentis group 8 of 191 eyes than in the laser group 30 of 203 eyes overall the drugs benefits are particularly clear for people with both pdr and dme we know that this drug will help treat both conditions at the same time so this is an especially appealing treatment alternative for these patients dr aiello noted lucentis should be considered a viable treatment option for people with pdr especially for individuals needing antivegf for dme said jeffrey g gross md of the carolina retina center in columbia south carolina who chaired the clinical study the study also suggested that lucentis may help prevent dme among people without this condition at the start of the study only 9 percent of lucentistreated eyes developed it compared with 28 percent in the laser group scientists will follow up on that result as the drcrnet continues to track patients for a total of five years a separate clinical trial now getting underway will examine whether antivegf injections given at an earlier stage of diabetic eye disease can help prevent people from developing both dme and the sightthreatening pdr stage of the disease at all dr aiello said the trial reported today is a major study that may substantially change our approach to treatment of pdr summed up dr sun laser still has a role in the treatment of pdr for some patients but antivegf therapy gives us another tool in our search for better vision outcomes in our patients with diabetes about joslin

real,memphis tenn oct 26 2015 prnewswire imagine a nick of the skin a flash of cold and 25 minutes on an exam table for thousands of women this may soon replace surgery as a treatment for breast cancer cryoablation using extreme cold to destroy diseased cells is potentially the first ever procedure to treat breast cancer tumors without the trauma of surgery following numerous limited studies a growing number of women are now being treated with the technique as part of a groundbreaking clinical trial involving leading breast cancer specialists across the country utilizing icecure medicals innovative icesense3 cryoablation system the multicenter trial is examining cryoablation of certain types of breast cancer potentially it will usher in a new and gentler pathway for the treatment of a disease that affects one in every eight women annually the benefits of cryoablation over traditional breast cancer surgery are significant the procedure is typically performed in a physicians office under ultrasound guidance in less than 30 minutes it involves a small incision and placement of an icesense3 nitrogencooled probe into the center of a tumor to freeze it from the inside out the diseased cells then crack open and die eventually they are absorbed by the immune system and new cells take their place by contrast surgical cancer removal often means several hours in the operating room complications of general anesthesia and weeks or months of recovery surgery also typically involves significant breast tissue damage and disfigurement due to large incisions and removal of sizable breast mass cryoablation however precisely targets the tumor site and involves insertion of only a slim probe therefore it boasts fast recovery time significantly improved cosmetic results and greater patient comfort overall in fact most women are able to resume normal activities almost immediately following treatment they experience minimal scarring and excellent cosmetic results physicians participating in the trial report that patients feel minimal discomfort and can watch the procedure on the ultrasound screen most are extremely relieved to avoid painful disfiguring surgery and long recovery times for women with certain types of breast cancer cryoablation is showing promise as an alternative to surgery particularly for patients over age 65 says susan k boolbol md chief of the appelvenet comprehensive breast service mount sinai beth israel who is participating in the trial for older patients the risks associated with invasive procedures and general anesthesia as well as the discomfort of long recoveries also makes this procedure particularly desirable as our understanding of tumor biology grows the ability to offer treatment options other than surgery is important there is growing awareness treatment should be based on individual tumor biology we are excited to be participating in this trial where some breast cancer patients can be treated without surgery adds richard fine md the west comprehensive breast center memphis tn another surgeon active in the cryoablation trial over the next 15 years women 65 and older will make up one of the fastest growing populations diagnosed with breast cancer we are confident that the ice3 trial can prove certain women can be successfully treated less aggressively than in the past the option of a nonsurgical treatment has significant benefits for patients and the overall health care system cryoablation is wellestablished in the treatment of liver kidney prostate and other cancers its effectiveness in breast cancer has been proven in a number of smaller studies including a recent american college of surgeons oncology group acosog trial and extensive longterm ongoing unpublished studies in japan the ice3 trial which began patient enrollment in october 2014 will significantly expand data on the technique as a treatment for breast cancer patents will be followed for five years to ensure they remain cancer free developed by icecure medical caesarea israelmemphis tn specifically for breast applications the icesense3 cryoablation system has a long history of successful treatment of benign breast fibroadenomas the ongoing refinement of the technology makes treatment more precise and extremely reliable the icesense3 device delivers a stable cycle of extremely cold temperatures and relies on a maneuverable disposable probe and compact high tech console for the first time these advances make precise targeting of tumors extremely reliable the ice3 trial is recruiting and following women aged 65 years and older diagnosed with certain tumor subtypes and measuring less than 15 centimeters in diameter developed by a diverse esteemed scientific advisory board the trial is underway at 20

real,share fast facts ct scans outperform stress tests in spotting clogged arteries click to tweet ct angiograms detect blockages in nine out of 10 people click to tweet tests can miss four out of 10 patients with clogged heart vessels click to tweet results of a headtohead comparison study led by johns hopkins researchers show that noninvasive ct scans of the hearts vessels are far better at spotting clogged arteries that can trigger a heart attack than the commonly prescribed exercise stress that most patients with chest pain undergo a report on the findings comparing ct angiograms and stress tests published online oct 14 in the journal circulation cardiovascular imaging show the scans correctly identified blockages in nine out of 10 people while stress tests picked up blockages in six out of 10 what renders the results of the new study particularly powerful researchers say is that each patient underwent all three tests for providing a direct headtohead comparison of their ability to accurately spot blockages no tests is 100 percent accurate 100 percent of the time but our findings indicate ct angiograms get pretty close to that coveted threshold says lead investigator armin zadeh md phd associate professor of medicine at the johns hopkins university school of medicine we hope our findings will settle any residual uncertainty about the effectiveness of these two common noninvasive heart tests the researchers note that the gold standard for detecting blocked arteries remains invasive cardiac angiography a test using dye and xrays that requires a catheter to be threaded into the hearts vessels but cardiologists have long relied on socalled stress testing as a simpler cheaper gatekeeper procedure to identify people more likely to benefit from the riskier more invasive and more costly catheterizations ct angiograms have recently emerged as yet another noninvasive alternative a handful of studies zadeh says have suggested ct angiographies may be superior but uncertainty has persisted due the small number of people involved in these analyses and stress tests have remained the more popular choice among clinicians results of the new study the research team says should help settle lingering doubts among physicians and the nearly 15 million americans who seek medical attention each year for symptoms that signal a clogged artery including chest pain shortness of breath and extreme fatigue in ct angiography clinicians use dye injected into the circulation to visualize blockages inside the arteries when the dye reaches impenetrable or narrowed passages clogged by fatty buildups or clots the scan shows a blockage the socalled nuclear exercise stress tests also use dye and ct scans but instead of directly visualizing the interior of the arteries they measure blood flow to the heart muscle immediately after a patient walks on a treadmill reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is a signal that a narrowed or blocked artery is not supplying the muscle with enough blood although exercise stress testing is generally safe for most people it can rarely trigger an abnormal heart rhythm or even an actual heart attack in people with seriously clogged arteries researchers emphasize that both nuclear stress tests and ct angiograms expose patients to radiation while many newer ct scans deliver substantially lower doses of radiation than the scans used in nuclear stress tests the dose and protocols can vary widely from hospital to hospital researchers say ct angiograms and nuclear stress tests carry similar price tags between 750 and 1200 researchers say the total tab stemming from either test including downstream costs related to additional testing due to unclear or unrelated findings remains unclear and should be an important consideration in crafting any new testing recommendations for the current study 391 patients ages 45 to 85 seen at 16 hospitals in eight countries underwent noninvasive ct angiograms followed by traditional catheterbased coronary angiographies within two months each patient also underwent an exercise stress test all patients had symptoms suggestive of heart disease but not all had a previous diagnosis of the condition overall noninvasive ct angiograms accurately detected or ruled out artery blockages in 91 percent of patients compared with 69 percent for stress testing when researchers analyzed test performance in a subgroup of 111 patients with very highrisk disease as identified on traditional angiography the diagnostic accuracy of ct angiograms went up to 96 percent compared with 80 percent for stress testing in other words researchers report stress tests missed two out of every 10 patients with severe disease marked by multiple blockages current guidelines from the american heart association and the american college cardiology call for a stress tests in all patients who show signs of coronary artery disease to confirm the diagnosis and define the severity of the blockage ct angiograms are generally reserved only for patients with borderline stress test results but given its much higher accuracy the researchers say ct angiography may be a better firstline test in people with symptoms suggestive of a blocked artery other investigators from johns hopkins included rodrigo cerci richard george andrea vavere joo lima jeffrey brinker and julie miller other institutions involved in the research included brigham and womens hospital charit hospital in germany st lukes hospital in japan beth israel deaconess medical center and the university of sao paulo in

real,using a high sensitivity blood test 1 researchers have identified the optimal level of a protein called troponin that could rule out a diagnosis of heart attack for twothirds of people attending the emergency department according to new research published in the lancet using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department say the authors until now there were no quick ways to rule out a heart attack within the emergency department explains lead author dr anoop shah from the university of edinburgh in the uk we have identified a cardiac troponin concentration less than 5 nanograms per deciliter <5 ngl below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days these patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department these findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers2 one of the most common causes of hospitalisation worldwide is acute chest pain in the uk alone chest pain is responsible for around 1 million visits to the emergency department every year international guidelines recommend that individuals presenting with chest pain are admitted to hospital for testing for very high levels of troponin above the 99th percentilea sign that a heart attack has occurred current approaches for assessing patients with suspected heart attacks either require admission into hospital or lengthy stays in the emergency department for repeat testing until now whether new highsensitivity cardiac troponin tests could identify very lowrisk patients who may be suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department was unknown the test used in this study is more sensitive than the standard version and can detect far lower levels of troponin in the blood using this test troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in scotland and the usa dr shah and colleagues prospectively evaluated the negative predictive value the probability that patients were not at risk of heart attack or subsequent death from a heart condition after 30 days for a range of troponin concentrations the researchers found that a troponin threshold of <5 ngl at presentation identified around twothirds 61 of patients at very low risk of heart attack and may have been eligible for early safe dischargewith a high negative predictive value of 996 this high negative predictive value persisted irrespective of age sex cardiovascular risk factors or prior cardiovascular disease at one year these patients had a three times lower risk of heart attack and cardiac death than those who had troponin levels 5 ngl or higher according to dr shah over the last two decades the number of hospital admissions due to chest pain has tripled the overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack this study shows that low plasma cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation identify up to twothirds of patients who are at very low risk of heart attack and could be safely discharged from the emergency department use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers2 writing in a linked comment louise cullen and william parsonage from the royal brisbane and womens hospital queensland australia and martin than from christchurch hospital new zealand say the ultimate validation for the safety and efficacy of discharging patients with cardiac troponin concentrations less than 5 ngl will be the report of clinical outcomes after this threshold is implemented in routine clinical practicefinally what further assessment if any is needed for those patients identified as low risk and suitable for early discharge trials are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of clinical pathways that involve no further testing for such patients
real,in a nutshell a study looked at the effects of weightloss surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer it found that bariatric surgery slashed participants weight by a third produced a mean weight loss of more than 100 pounds eliminated precancerous uterine growths improved physical quality of life improved insulin levels and glucose use altered the composition of gut bacteria charlottesville va oct 1 2015 a study evaluating the effects of bariatric surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer has found that the weightloss surgery slashed participants weight by a third and eliminated precancerous uterine growths in those that had them other effects included improving patients physical quality of life improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose which may reduce their risk for diabetes and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria the study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health if you look at cancers in women about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the us said susan c modesitt md of the university of virginia cancer center when youre looking at obesityrelated cancers the biggest one is endometrial cancer but also colon cancer breast cancer renal cancer and gall bladder cancer we think about 40 percent to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer which is in the lining of the uterus is caused by obesity effects of obesity and morbid obesity the study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 442 years and a mean body mass index bmi of 509 women are considered obese at a bmi of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 which is typically about 100 pounds over a womans ideal body weight yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese the study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe one to three years after surgery a total of 68 participants underwent the procedure two opted out of the surgery and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery the effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds preventing cancer ten percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus and all of those resolved with weight loss were talking about small numbers really tiny numbers of study participants modesitt said noting one limitation of the study so i could never say that effect is definitive but it is suggestive given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity modesitt of the uvas division of gynecologic oncology in the department of obstetrics and gynecology was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome the population of microorganisms living inside us the study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration but i dont even know what to say about that except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer for example before groundbreaking work by dr john marshall at uva in the past no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity but metabolic parametermarkers of the bacteria definitely changed after study participants lost weight while the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery we really should be working on diet and exercise from the getgo in our entire society starting with our children and exercise does seem to be protective even if you dont lose all the weight it absolutely has beneficial effects she said there are lots of studies showing if you exercise it improves your insulin your glucose all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancercausing effect almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels but losing excess weight would also be good

real,for the first time an immune checkpoint inhibitor has been proven to increase survival among patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma rcc a patient population for whom treatment options are currently limited researchers at the university of texas md anderson cancer center demonstrated a median overall survival benefit of 25 months with nivolumab a food and drug administration fdaapproved immunotherapy agent compared with 196 months for everolimus a current standard of care for patients with metastatic kidney cancer published online by the new england journal of medicine and being presented this week at a presidential session of the european cancer congress ecc the findings of checkmate025 provide definitive evidence that an immune checkpoint inhibitor is a valid treatment strategy for patients with advanced rcc and supports a paradigm change in the standard of care treatment according to the authors nivolumab marketed as opdivo is currently used to treat metastatic melanoma and advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer checkmate025 is an example of how investigators are examining approved immunotherapy drugs to determine potential impact on other tumor types immunotherapy has long been believed to have the potential to make an impact in kidney cancer but until now we had not been able to demonstrate such a significant survival benefit we have a real opportunity to change clinical practice for patients when other therapies have failed said principal investigator padmanee sharma md phd professor departments of genitourinary medical oncology and immunology and scientific director of the immunotherapy platform part of md andersons moon shots program through studies such as checkmate025 we are learning to target the patients immune systems to fight cancer rather than targeting the tumor itself this is a new way forward in the randomized phase iii clinical trial patients whose disease progressed on antiangiogenic therapies were treated with either nivolumab or everolimus median overall survival was 54 months longer with nivolumab 25 months compared with everolimus 196 months the study included 821 patients with advanced rcc across 151 sites in 24 countries in north america europe australia south america and asia all had previously been treated with one or two antiangiogenic therapies drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels a critical component of cancer development the median duration of treatment was 55 months with nivolumab and 37 months with everolimus in addition to demonstrating increased overall survival the researchers showed a higher objective response rate the number of patients who respond to the treatment with nivolumab of the 821 patients enrolled 25 responded to nivolumab versus 5 of those treated with everolimus among these patients partial responses were observed in 24 of those treated with nivolumab and 5 of patients treated with everolimus complete responses were observed in 1 four patients treated with nivolumab and fewer than 1 two patients treated with everolimus further among patients who showed a response the impact was durable according to sharma while median progressionfree survival appeared similar between treatments 46 months and 44 months with nivolumab and everolimus respectively when researchers explored a delayed progressionfree survival benefit at six months they reported 156 months with nivolumab and 117 months with everolimus this ongoing response was observed among 44 of those treated with nivolumab and 36 of those treated with everolimus more than 12 months later 31 and 27 of patients treated with nivolumab and everolimus respectively continued to show a response for some patients even after treatment with nivolumab ended response to the drug continued the immune system has a memory so even when treatment has stopped the body continues to exhibit a longterm response meaning these patients can live normal lives without progressive disease finally the investigators observed fewer treatmentrelated adverse events including fatigue and nausea and improved quality of life with nivolumab trial halted early breakthrough therapy designation granted by fda these results led the trial to be halted early in july 2015 when an assessment conducted by the independent data monitoring committee dmc concluded that the study met its primary endpoint demonstrating superior overall survival in patients receiving nivolumab nivolumab blocks a t cell inhibitory signaling pathway known as pd1 that controls the immune response and can prevent the immune system from attacking cancerous cells the drug is approved for metastatic melanoma patients who show no response to other treatments and for advanced squamous nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc with progression on or after chemotherapy based on the checkmate025 findings earlier this month september 16 the fda granted breakthrough therapy designation to nivolumab for the potential indication of metastatic rcc the breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible the next questions are how do we increase the number of patients who respond and how do we move immune checkpoint agents into the frontline setting not just using them when other therapies have failed but intervening earlier said sharma were studying combination therapies to answer these questions and believe these studies will change the way we treat many cancers each year there are 338000 new cases of rcc diagnosed worldwide it is the most common type of kidney cancer among adults and approximately 30 of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis according to the scientific literature a number of targeted therapies have been approved in recent years for the treatment of advanced rcc with five antiangiogenic and two mtor inhibitors including everolimus these drugs block a protein that regulates cell growth proliferation survival etc showing benefits in pivotal phase iii trials while these treatments have changed the therapeutic landscape for rcc they are associated with limited survival following emerging resistance to therapy said sharma the overall survival benefit shown in this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced rcc patients in need of a secondline therapy sharma is scientific director of md andersons immunotherapy platform which provides immune monitoring expertise to md andersons 85 clinical trials of immunotherapy drugs as single agents or in combinations platform investigators conduct research to understand which patients will benefit from immunotherapy to evaluate effective drug combinations and to identify new molecules that block or stimulate immune response the platform is part of md andersons moon shots program which is designed to harness scientific knowledge and develop new technologies that will dramatically reduce cancer deaths through prevention early detection and treatment

real,new york ny september 22 2015 the us preventive services task force uspstf recommendation against regular prostate specific antigen psa screening for prostate cancer is controversial while it may reduce the risk of over diagnosis and overtreatment the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern because of the potential for delayed diagnoses of important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment according to investigators reporting in the journal of urology prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the us with nearly 30000 deaths annually deaths from prostate cancer have declined by about 40 since the advent of psa screening in the late 1980s and 4070 of that decline may be attributable to screening however radiation therapy and surgery have a negative impact on quality of life the uncertain benefit of psa based screening combined with the complications associated with treatment led the uspstf to conclude in october 2011 that the harms of psa based screening outweighed the benefits leading it to recommend against regular screening our study was designed to assess the impact of the uspstf recommendation on screening practices among urologists and primary care providers and the incidence of prostate cancer explained lead investigator daniel a barocas md mph of the department of urologic surgery vanderbilt university medical center nashville tennessee we know there is decreased utilization of psa testing in some institutions and health systems but has the number of incident cases per month changed substantially since the draft guideline was issued investigators evaluated the effect of the uspstf guideline on the number and distribution of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the us they identified incident cancers diagnosed between january 2010 and december 2012 in the national cancer database and assessed the trend of new prostate cancers diagnosed each month before and after the draft guideline was issued comparing their findings with colon cancer this study helped quantify the potential benefits reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men and potential harms missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment the number of prostate cancer diagnoses dropped by more than 12 1363 cases in the month after the uspstf draft guideline was issued and the number continued to drop resulting in an overall decline of 28 in incident prostate cancer diagnoses in the year after the draft guideline was issued by contrast the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable diagnoses of low intermediate and high risk prostate cancers all decreased significantly but new diagnoses of nonlocalized disease did not change the decreases were similar across all subgroups of age comorbidity race income and insurance the study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 379 and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata suggesting that in this regard the uspstf recommendation had its intended effect similarly new diagnoses had fallen by 230293 among men over age 70 and by 260 among infirm men populations at risk for harms of treatment but unlikely to live long enough to benefit from early detection however the study also identified a drop of 281 in diagnoses of intermediate risk disease and 231 in high risk prostate cancer one year after the draft guideline which could result in missing important opportunities to spare men with higher risk cancers from progressive disease and cancer death while some of the effects of this guideline may be beneficial in terms of reducing harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern for delayed diagnoses of important cancers associated with inferior cancer outcomes noted dr barocas future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences
real,champaign ill a new surgical tool that uses light to make sure surgeons removing cancerous tumors got it all was found to correlate well with traditional pathologists diagnoses in a clinical study showing that the tool could soon enable reliable realtime guidance for surgeons the interdisciplinary research team led by stephen boppart a university of illinois professor of electrical and computer engineering and of bioengineering performed the study on 35 patients with breast cancers at the carle foundation hospital in urbana illinois the results appear in the journal cancer research one difficult but crucial determination for surgeons and tissue pathologists is figuring out where a tumor ends a solid tumor may be easily identifiable but the tissue around the main body of the tumor known as the margin may contain cancerous cells as well because of this excess tissue surrounding the tumor is typically removed but the question lingers of whether any cancer cells remain to reemerge later as tumors in almost all solidtumor surgeries theres a question of margins said dr boppart who also is a medical doctor typically surgeons will remove the tissue mass that contains the tumor and will send it to the lab the pathologist will process section and stain the tissue then examine the thin sections on microscope slides they look at the structure of the cells and other features of the tissue the diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted this is what we call the gold standard for diagnosis the new device is a handheld probe based on a technology called optical coherence tomography oct that uses light to image tissue in real time cancer cells and normal tissue scatter light differently because they have different microstructural and molecular features boppart said so oct gives physicians a way to quantitatively measure the cellular feature of a tumor surgeons can pass the oct wand over a section of tissue and see a video on a screen with no special chemical stains or lengthy tissue processing required in many cases you cant tell the difference between cancer cells and normal tissue with the naked eye but with oct theyre very different said boppart who also is affiliated with the beckman institute for advanced science and technology at the u of i in the clinical study surgeons treated patients according to the standard surgical procedure but oct data were collected from the margin of the tumor cavity and the margin of the removed tissue mass during surgery so that the results could be compared later the study found that the oct device analysis identified the differences between normal and cancerous tissue with 92 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity they also found that the way that oct spotted cancer in the removed tissue was closely correlated with the results from the postoperative pathology reports which often came days later for the first time this study demonstrates the use of oct for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity in the patient during surgery boppart said it is likely better to check to see if any residual tumor cells might be left behind rather than checking the tissue mass that was taken out then the surgeon can intervene immediately the researchers will continue clinical studies with the oct device looking at other types of solidstate tumors diagnostic photonics a startup company boppart cofounded that also collaborated on the study is commercializing the oct probe technology for broader use ultimately new technological innovations like this in medicine and surgery are going to improve our health care and save lives thats when this work will be most rewarding boppart said

real,in a firstofitskind study researchers demonstrate a benefit in overall survival among epithelial ovarian cancer eoc patients receiving generic heart medications known as betablockers survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed firstgeneration nonselective betablockers according to the university of texas md anderson cancer center investigators the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread with further research they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types published today in the journal cancer the findings are the result of a multiinstitutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010 researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented betablocker use during chemotherapy and those without among the 269 patients who received betablockers 193 717 percent received beta1adrenergic receptor selective agents sbbs and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists nsbbs the research team found for patients receiving any betablocker the median overall survival was 478 months versus 42 months for nonusers median overall survival based on betablocker receptor selectivity was 949 months for those receiving nsbbs versus 38 months for those receiving sbbs even among patients with hypertension a longer median overall survival was observed among users of nsbbs compared with nonusers 90 months versus 382 months this study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator anil sood md professor in gynecologic medical oncology and cancer biology at md anderson it showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers and that betablockers among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine might be a new way to stifle that effect betablockers treat a variety of conditions such as heart disease highblood pressure glaucoma and migraines they target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones sood said our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment according to sood the usefulness of betablockers was unclear until now the ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents which inhibit a specific stress pathway is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis he added that betablocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease had an increased average bmi and were more likely to be hypertensive all these factors were associated with decreased survival yet those who received betablockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival further examination revealed that nsbb users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities this was not true for patients who took sbbs although further study is needed these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor2 adrb2 a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by nsbbs versus the adrb1 pathway targeted by sbbs ovarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer an estimated 21290 new cases are diagnosed and some 14180 women die from the disease each year in the us according to the american cancer society future trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from betablocker use and the best betablocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth delays in wound healing and metastasis betablockers may also reduce cancerrelated psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients according to the study authors there are currently two clinical trials one led by md anderson evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol a type of nsbb on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed eoc according to sood the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective randomized clinical trials examining nsbbs on patient outcomes the stratification of patients by betablocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer it also builds on the mounting evidence that betablockers may become a key treatment component for many patients in the future said sood

real,a veterans affairs database study of more than 83000 patients found that men whose low testosterone was restored to normal through gels patches or injections had a lower risk of heart attack stroke or death from any cause versus similar men who were not treated the study also found that men who were treated but did not attain normal levels did not see the same benefits as those whose levels did reach normal the study was published online aug 6 2015 in the european heart journal the findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapys benefits and risks especially for the heart studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods for example the new va study excluded men with a history of heart attacks or strokes although it did include those with existing heart disease a muchcited va database study that was published in jama in 2013 looked specifically at men with coronary artery disease about 20 percent of the total study group of around 8700 men had suffered a prior heart attack so far the medical community lacks results from any definitive clinical trial that might provide clear guidance meanwhile the food and drug administration issued guidance earlier in 2015 advising clinicians about the overuse of testosterone therapy and pointing to a possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke the new va study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long followup period dr rajat barua the papers corresponding author says the study is also noteworthy because of its finding that administering the right dose is critical treating low t but not restoring levels to normal doesnt appear to impart much benefit at least in terms of cardiovascular risk testosterone isnt prescribed with the goal of improving heart health but that is a consideration in many cases it is the first study to demonstrate that significant benefit is observed only if the dose is adequate to normalize the total testosterone levels barua and his coauthors wrote patients who failed to achieve the therapeutic range after testosterone replacement therapy did not see a reduction in heart attack or stroke and had significantly less benefit on mortality barua is with the kansas city mo va medical center hes also an assistant professor of medicine at the university of kansas the study team looked at national data on more than 83000 men with documented low testosterone all age 50 or above who received care in va between 1999 and 2014 the researchers divided the men into three clinical groups those who were treated to the point where their total testosterone levels returned to normal group 1 those who were treated but without reaching normal group 2 and those who were untreated and remained at low levels group 3 importantly all three groups were propensity matched so the comparisons would be between men with similar health profiles the researchers took into account a wide array of factors that might affect cardiovascular and overall risk they included for example age body mass index various chronic diseases ldl cholesterol levels and the use of aspirin beta blockers and statins the average followup across the groups ranged from 46 to 62 years the sharpest contrast emerged between group 1 those who were treated and attained normal levels and group 3 those whose low testosterone went untreated the treated men were 56 percent less likely to die during the followup period 24 percent less likely to suffer a heart attack and 36 percent less likely to have a stroke the differences between group 1 and group 2 those who were treated but did not attain normal levels were similar but less pronounced little difference emerged between groups 2 and 3 except for a slight benefit in survival for those who were treated barua and colleagues say they dont know the exact reasons for testosterones apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival the mechanisms for these effects remain speculative they write possible explanations they say could involve body fat insulin sensitivity lipids blood platelets inflammation or other biological pathways more research is needed they say to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system while the new study results do seem to advocate for testosterone replacement therapy barua stresses the need for appropriate screening selection dosing and followup of patients to maximize the benefit of testosterone therapy the authors also caution that offlabel use remains a concern in other words doctors should not write a prescription simply because an older man is complaining of symptoms such as low energy and low sex drive according to the fda testosterone products are fdaapproved only for use in men who lack or have low testosterone levels in conjunction with an associated medical condition examples of these conditions include failure of the testicles to produce testosterone because of reasons such as genetic problems or chemotherapy none of the fdaapproved testosterone products are approved for use in men with low testosterone levels who lack an associated medical condition
real,minneapolis aug 7 2015 prnewswireusnewswire new technology that tracks the eye movements of patients may be a more accurate measure of brain injury than any other diagnostic measurements currently in use according to a study recently published in the journal concussion dr uzma samadani who recently joined the faculty at hennepin county medical center in collaboration with researchers at the steven and alexandra cohen veterans center at nyu langone medical center developed the technology that can serve as a biomarker for concussion by tracking patients eye movements as they watch music videos the eye tracking technology works by having patients watch a music video for 220 seconds while eye movements are measured using a tracking camera videos used in the study ranged from disneys puss in boots to wavin flag by knaan multiple measures of each eyes movement followed by comparisons of their positions over time are used to distinguish between normal subjects and those with concussion in the work led by uzma samadani md phd charles marmar md and eugene laska phd the investigators built a classifier based on 34 emergency room patients with brain injury and 34 uninjured healthy control subjects of similar age a classifier is a mathematical model that converts a patients eye movement measures into a prediction of the concussive status of the individual they then tested the models on a dataset of 255 subjects of whom 8 had concussions and found that the eye tracking test had an optimal sensitivity of 88 and specificity of 87 typically a classifier produces a score and a subject is classified as having a concussion if the score exceeds a predefined threshold value the accuracy of a biomarker is measured by plotting the probability of a true versus false positivity at each possible threshold value and the area under the curve auc is computed a perfect biomarker has an auc of 100 while a worthless marker no better than the chance toss of a coin has an auc of 050 most tests used clinically have aucs greater than 080 for example serum troponin the most commonly performed blood test for heart attacks has an auc ranging in various studies from 076 to 096 in this study the eye tracking based classifier had an auc of 088 and a crossvalidated auc of 085 according to dr samadani the major challenge for any technology proposed as a biomarker for concussion is first defining concussion when doctors look for a biomarker for heart attack it is relatively easy to check the accuracy of a potential candidate because they can perform a cardiac catheterization and confirm that the heart vessel is blocked and an attack has occurred there is no analogous capability with brain injury there is no gold standard diagnostic no blood test and no imaging study for definitively concluding that a patient has experienced a concussion we use symptom severity scales and standardized cognitive examination assessments but the imperfect nature of these may result in incorrect subject classification potentially eye tracking may be more accurate than it appears because of its objective appraisal of a complicated process of coordination that may be impaired the investigators defined concussion as 1 trauma to the head with a normal ct computed tomography scan of the brain 2 symptom severity score of 40 or greater on scat3 testing and 3 standardized assessment of concussion sac score less than 24 the symptom severity score measures the selfreported severity of 22 concussion symptoms ranging from headache to dizziness and irritability the sac measures orientation memory and concentration capabilities which have some variability even among uninjured healthy control subjects in an accompanying editorial that also appears in the journal dr samadani proposes that eye tracking will help diagnose and classify brain injury and concussion particularly in patients with elevated pressure inside their skulls and disruption of pathways in the brain that control eye movements the ultimate goal for brain injury said dr samadani is to achieve the same level of diagnostic capability and care as currently exists for other medical conditions right now when someone comes in to the emergency room with chest pain doctors perform an ekg blood test imaging and treatment with brain injury we need to be able to achieve the same level of care to assess all aspects of the problem rigorously classify and treat accordingly we already know that there is much more to brain injury than what is seen on a ct scan eye tracking tells us how well the brain is working regardless of how it looks and represents the beginning of a solution to this problem it is noninvasive inexpensive and extremely quick testing does not require reading nor language skills which makes it useful for multiple patient populations commenting further on the study was dr david cifu the herman j flax md professor and chair of rehabilitation at virginia commonwealth university senior tbi specialist with the us department of veterans affairs and principal investigator of the vadepartment of defense chronic effects of neurotrauma consortium

real,san diego july 14 2015 prnewswire genomedx biosciences today announced that a study featured on the cover of urology demonstrates that decipher prostate cancer classifier significantly influenced treatment recommendations following prostate surgery reducing disagreement between urologists and radiation oncologists and has the potential to enhance personalization of patient care decipher is a medicarecovered genomic test capable of predicting tumor aggressiveness in men following prostate surgery the study titled impact of a genomic classifier of metastatic risk on postprostatectomy treatment recommendations by radiation oncologists and urologists was published in this months issue of urology conflicting treatment recommendations by different specialists looking at the same disease can be highly confusing for patients and is a problem for the health care system in general said paul nguyen md of danafarberbrigham and womens cancer center and harvard medical school the decipher tests tendency to make the two specialties more concordant in their treatment recommendations provides significant value toward standardizing care for patients the study was designed to evaluate how the decipher prostate cancer classifier which predicts the risk of metastasis after prostatectomy would impact adjuvant treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists these two specialties often disagree on which patients should receive radiation therapy following surgery and when using clinical information alone observation rather than adjuvant radiation therapy was recommended in 42 of decisions made by urologists and 23 of decisions by radiation oncologists p < 0001 the decipher test results altered 45 and 35 of treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists respectively decipher results indicating genomic high risk resulted in intensification of treatment whereas genomic low risk resulted in less aggressive recommendations the decipher results increased agreement in treatment recommendations between urologists and radiation oncologists as the odds of a recommendation for adjuvant treatment by urologists vs radiation oncologists increased from 027 95 ci 017044 to 046 95 ci 029075 after results of the decipher test were made available it is notable that while the decipher test significantly influenced treatment decisions it did not increase the total number of people receiving adjuvant therapy suggesting that it helped ensure that the ones selected for adjuvant therapy are the ones most likely to benefit from it said doug dolginow md chief executive officer of genomedx as genomic tests like decipher become used more routinely in urologic cancer patient care they will have a greater impact on treatment recommendations in clinical practice and allow for better personalization of therapy the decipher test used in this study has been previously described in multiple blinded independent validation studies in men at high risk of recurrence at the time of prostatectomy researchers found that 60 of the clinically highrisk men would be reclassified as low risk based on the decipher test and have only a 24 risk of metastasis at 5 years after surgery in addition the 19 of the patients with the highest risk based on decipher had a nearly 10fold higher risk of distant metastases by 5 years the test provided a more accurate and precise estimate of a patients risk of recurrence use of this test therefore has the potential to assist clinicians to better direct utilization of secondary therapy after surgery about decipher the decipher prostate cancer classifier is a highly validated and commercially available genomic test for men with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer decipher predicts cancer aggressiveness by looking for a unique genomic signature comprised of a validated series of biomarkers associated with metastatic disease adding truly unique information to the treatment decisionmaking process decipher generates a risk result that is completely independent and distinct from psa gleason score and other clinical risk factors clinical studies from leading cancer centers published in over a dozen medical journals demonstrate that decipher can accurately predict metastatic disease which men may benefit from radiation therapy following

real,effectiveness shown in tests on ovarian and bowel cancer drug can shut down a cancer cells metabolism developed by researchers at the university of warwicks warwick cancer research centre tests conducted by the wellcome trust sanger institutes cancer genome project new drug could be cheaper to produce and less harmful to healthy cells tests have shown that a new cancer drug fy26 is 49 times more potent than the clinically used treatment cisplatin based on a compound of the rare precious metal osmium and developed by researchers at the university of warwicks department of chemistry and the warwick cancer research unit fy26 is able to shut down a cancer cell by exploiting weaknesses inherent in their energy generation the researchers argue that the drug could be cheaper to produce less harmful to healthy cells than existing treatments and has been shown to be active against cancer cells which have become resistant to platinumbased drugs the experiments conducted by the wellcome trust sanger institute comprising 809 cancer cell lines found that fy26 was 49 times more potent than cisplatin similar results were obtained by the national cancer institute usa in tests conducted on 60 cell lines the new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria the power house of a cell to generate the energy necessary to function whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cells energy requirements in the absence of fy26 cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy by stopping this switch of energy source the drug causes the cancer cell to die lead researcher professor peter sadler of the university of warwicks department of chemistry said explains healthy cells generate their energy in organelles called mitochondria but cancer cells have defective mitochondria and are forced to generate energy through glycolysis in the cytoplasm our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells commenting on the drugs benefits when compared to existing platinumbased drugs such as cisplatin professor sadler says platinumbased drugs are used in nearly 50 of all chemotherapeutic regimens and exert their activity by damaging dna and cannot select between cancerous and noncancerous cells this can lead to a widerange of sideeffects from renal failure to neurotoxicity ototoxicity nausea and vomiting existing platinumbased cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as cisplatin the research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates suggests coresearcher dr isolda romerocanelon current statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the uk according to cancer research uk and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer it is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells the research supported by the european research council and titled potent organoosmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells is published by pnas the paper describes the comprehensive systems biology approach used to elucidate the mechanism of osmium action of fy26 led by phd student jess hearn importantly this analysis also pinpointed 3 mutations in the mitochondrial dna of ovarian cancer cells following the successful test results the researchers have been awarded a wellcome trust pathfinder grant to begin preclinical development of organoosmium compounds ends pr144 7 july 2015 notes the researchers thank the biotechnology and biological sciences research council grant 324594 systems biology studentship for jmh the european research council grants 247450 and 324594 and the wellcome trust grants 086357 and 102696 for support as well as the european union cost action cm1105 cancer drug 49 times more potent than cisplatin
real,seattle june 24 for the first time researchers at fred hutchinson cancer research center have found that weight loss in combination with vitamin d supplementation has a greater effect on reducing chronic inflammation than weight loss alone chronic inflammation is known to contribute to the development and progression of several diseases including some cancers results of the randomized controlled clinical trial which involved more than 200 overweight postmenopausal women who had insufficient levels of vitamin d at the beginning of the study are published online ahead of the july print issue of cancer prevention research a journal of the american association for cancer research we know from our previous studies that by losing weight people can reduce their overall levels of inflammation and there is some evidence suggesting that taking vitamin d supplements can have a similar effect if one has insufficient levels of the nutrient said lead and corresponding author catherine duggan phd a principal staff scientist in the public health sciences division at fred hutch however it has not been known whether combining the two weight loss and vitamin d would further boost this effect its the first study to test whether adding vitamin d augments the considerable effect of weight loss on inflammatory biomarkers she said to explore this question duggan and colleagues recruited 218 healthy overweight older women who had lowerthanrecommended levels of vitamin d less than 32 ngml the women then took part in a 12month diet and exercise program including 45 minutes of moderatetovigorous exercise five days a week half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive 2000 iu of vitamin d daily for the duration of the yearlong trial and the other half received an identicalappearing placebo or dummy vitamin biomarkers of inflammation were measured at the beginning and end of the study the researchers then compared changes in these levels between the two groups at the end of the study all of the participants had reduced levels of inflammation regardless of whether they took vitamin d which highlights the importance of weight loss in reducing inflammation duggan said however those who saw the most significant decline in markers of inflammation were those who took vitamin d and lost 5 to 10 percent of their baseline weight these study participants had a 37 percent reduction in a proinflammatory cytokine called interleukin6 or il6 as compared to those in the placebo group who saw a 172 percent reduction in il6 the researchers found similar results among women in the vitamin d group who lost more than 10 percent of their starting weight while il6 has normal functions in the body elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers and diabetes and may be implicated as a cause of depression duggan said we were quite surprised to see that vitamin d had an effect on an inflammation biomarker only among women who lost at least 5 percent of their baseline weight duggan said that suggests vitamin d can augment the effect of weight loss on inflammation vitamin d is a steroid hormone that has multiple functions beyond its widely recognized role in regulating calcium levels and bone metabolism vitamin d receptors are found in more than 30 cell types and the research focus around this nutrient recently has shifted from bone health to vitamin ds effect on cancer cardiovascular health and weight loss among other health issues inflammation occurs when the body is exposed to pathogens such as bacteria or viruses which puts the immune system in overdrive until the attack ceases and the inflammatory response abates overweight or obese people however exist in a state of chronic inflammation this sustained upregulation of the inflammatory response occurs because fat tissue continually produces cytokines molecules that are usually only present for a short time while the body is fighting infection for example it is thought that this state of chronic inflammation is protumorigenic that is it encourages the growth of cancer cells she said there is also some evidence that increased body mass dilutes vitamin d possibly by sequestering it in fat tissue weight loss reduces inflammation and thus represents another mechanism for reducing cancer risk duggan said if ensuring that vitamin d levels are replete or at an optimum level can decrease inflammation over and above that of weight loss alone that can be an important addition to the tools people can use to reduce their cancer risk duggan encourages women to speak to their health care providers about measuring their levels of vitamin d to determine the most appropriate dosage
real,a new test can accurately predict within minutes if an individual has ebola virus disease evd according to new research published in the lancet the study is the first to show that a pointofcare evd test reebov antigen rapid test corgenix is faster than and as sensitive as a conventional laboratorybased molecular method used for clinical testing during the recent outbreak in sierra leone this new rapid diagnostic test rdt could cut back on the lengthy process usually required to confirm if a patient has evd help identify case contacts and ultimately curb the spread of ebola currently diagnosis of evd requires a full vial of venous blood to be shipped to a laboratory with a high level of biosafety and staff expertise for testing by realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr this method poses substantial risks to the healthcare workers responsible for blood collection transport and testing and efforts to contain the ebola epidemic in west africa have been hampered by this slow and complex diagnostic test laboratory results can sometimes take days to return delays like this result not only in the failure to diagnose and treat ebolainfected patients but also in individuals without ebola being admitted to holding units where they may be subsequently infected with the virus 1 explains dr nira pollock senior author and associate medical director of the infectious diseases diagnostic laboratory at the boston childrens hospital usa this new test on the other hand is capable of detecting the ebola virus in just a small drop of blood tested at the bedside and could help us in the fight against ebola 1 in this study the researchers compared the diagnostic accuracy of the new rdt against the benchmark rtpcr test altona diagnostics being used for clinical diagnosis in the field reference laboratory run by public health england at port loko in sierra leone 106 suspected ebola patients admitted to two treatment centres in sierra leone run by the ministry of health and sanitation of sierra leone and supported by the nongovernmental organisation partners in health during february 2015 were tested by both rdt performed on a fingerstick blood sample at the pointofcare and by standard rtpcr performed on plasma in the laboratory both rdt on whole blood and rtpcr on plasma were also performed on 284 samples in the laboratory the rdt detected all confirmed cases of evd that were positive by rtpcr in both pointofcare 28105 patients and laboratory testing 45277 patients with sensitivity of 100 identifying all patients with evd as per the benchmark method and a specificity of 92 identifying patients who didnt have evd surprisingly the findings also revealed that the standard altona rtpcr test under the conditions deployed in the field was itself an imperfect reference standard the altona rtpcr assay failed to detect a small number of evd cases that tested positive by both rdt and by an alternative rtpcr test trombley all with relatively low amounts of virus both the rdt and altona assays failed to detect a small number of evd cases that tested positive by the trombley test all with very low amounts of virus the authors caution that given the limitations of the performance of the altona rtpcr reference test in patients with low levels of the virus in their blood more research is needed to assess how the new rdt will perform in patients very early in the course of evd according to coauthor dr jana broadhurst from partners in health boston usa this test could have an immediate impact on patient care and infection control by reliably detecting patients well into their illness who are likely to be highly infectious earlier test results would improve triage of patients enabling staff to focus on those most likely to have ebola and reducing the opportunity for infection of nonebola suspects although the rdt requires refrigeration this is already available in many health centres in endemic areas particularly those that store vaccines and other medical products 1 writing in a linked comment dr nahid bhadelia from boston university school of medicine and boston medical center boston usa says this study validates the accuracy of the reebov rdt in patients who are well into their illnesssuggesting it could be used to triage this subset of patients if rtpcr is not available particularly in those with a high index of clinical suspicion for a differential diagnosisthe data presented provide crucial information about the point ofcare function of this rapid diagnostic test such as ease of use quality of samples taken at the bedside and the concordance with venous samplesthe results raise caution regarding the performance of the widely used altona rtpcr assay which the authors suggest might have underperformed because of laboratory specific technical and performance factors
real,rome italy 13 june 2015 the results of a study presented today at the european league against rheumatism annual congress eular 2015 showed that in rheumatoid arthritis ra patients a good clinical response to maintenance treatment with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor tnfi was maintained even when the dose was reduced by onethird reducing the tnfi dose by twothirds resulted in more flares exacerbations of symptoms and signs but these subsided when the higher dose of tnfi was restarted and did not adversely affect subsequent progression of any disability in some cases however patients maintained a clinical response after stopping the tnfi altogether the optimal management of ra involves achieving the lowest possible disease activity ideally remission and then maintaining this level of control said lead author dr james galloway department of rheumatology kings college hospital nhs foundation trust uk findings from our study have shown that adopting a tnfi dose reduction strategy can still meet this objective with no compromise on symptom control for the patient and offering a more costeffective option by substantially reducing the high drug costs associated with tnfi maintenance therapy ra is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by joint inflammation and damage functional disability and significantly increased mortality early intervention using a conventional synthetic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug dmard such as methotrexate is critical in preventing structural joint damage and progressive loss of function for those patients who either fail to respond or who develop an inadequate response to these drugs over time a biologic dmard is an effective addon treatment option2 the first choice of biologic therapy is usually a tnfi2 and currently identical dosing regimens of tnfi are used both to induce and then maintain a clinical response1 over the first six months of the study flares exacerbations of symptoms and signs occurred in 14 of patients who stayed on the same tnfi dose compared to a similar figure of 13 in those patients for whom the dose was reduced by onethird a twothirds dose reduction increased the odds of a flare occurring by four times compared with a onethird dose reduction with flares occurring in 37 of patients postdose reduction flares resolved when the original dose of tnfi was restarted there were no significant differences in selfreported measures of disability health assessment questionnaire score with either dose reduction strategy at six months the opttira study is a 12month multicentre randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate if reducing tnfi doses of either etanercept or adalimumab caused a loss of response in ra patients who were also receiving a synthetic dmard to be eligible patients had to demonstrate stable low disease activity das28 less than 32 for over three months patients with serious concomitant illness or those taking highdose steroids more than 10mg prednisolone daily were excluded of the 47 patients who reduced then stopped their tnfi after six months 45 2147 succeeded without flaring and their final mean das28 score after stopping treatment was 22 demonstrating low disease activity
real,newswise montreal june 8 2015 weekly sessions of noninvasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation provided sufficient longterm pain relief in 61 percent of patients with central poststroke pain and delivered longterm relief for patients who continued for one year according to a study presented at the international neuromodulation society 12th world congress by masahito kobayashi md phd of the department of neurosurgery saitama medical university department of neurology institute of brain and blood vessels mihara memorial hospital in saitama japan of 18 patients in the openlabel series 11 patients achieved satisfactorytoexcellent pain relief pain relief was sustained in six patients who continued treatment for one year all patients received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms to their primary motor cortex once a week for at least 12 weeks satisfactory relief was considered a 40 69 percent reduction in pain scores 6 patients and excellent relief pain reduction of 70 percent or more 5 patients overall 8 patients who had severe strokecaused dysesthesias such as uncomfortable numbness or prickling experienced less relief than patients without severe dysesthesias suggesting possible neural circuit damage was inhibiting response to treatment the study participants had all been treated medically after a blood clot or bleed in one side of the brain unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke several weeks into their recovery they had begun to experience severe hand or leg pain as a consequence of brain damage from the stroke such central poststroke pain can be extremely disabling and difficult to treat impacting general functioning mood and overall quality of life since the 1990s japan has been an active center of research into the study of electrical motor cortex stimulation emcs to treat poststroke pain using surgically implanted devices the study reported at the ins 12th world congress builds on observations that electrical motor cortex stimulations effectiveness in relieving central poststroke pain can be predicted by rtms suggesting the techniques share similar painrelief mechanisms however kobayashi and colleagues point out in their peerreviewed online publication of this study repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation once a week induces sustainable longterm relief of central poststroke pain neuromodulation technology at the neural interface april 23 20151 that there has still been controversy about the efficacy of rtms in poststroke pain kobayashi said in comparison to emcs his impression is rtms efficacy seemed almost the same without requiring surgery in 2014 a review2 suggested that there is probable efficacy a level a recommendation for shortterm rtms treatment of neuropathic pain including central poststroke pain but did not speak to longterm efficacy since pain relief from rtms increases a few days after treatment weekly treatment sessions were selected to try to sustain pain relief at treatment intervals that could be maintained on an outpatient basis kobayashi believes neurologists would especially have an interest in this method which is also attractive due to its low sideeffect profile none of the 18 patients reported any serious side effects from weekly sessions of 10 trains of 10second 5hz rtms at 90 percent of the active motor threshold two patients reported transient slight scalp discomfort after rtms in addition to the potential of rtms in pain relief there has been growing research into noninvasive stimulation to augment progress in physical rehabilitation soon after stroke it is believed that the stimulation aids in plasticity the ability of the brain to gradually form new neural connections to take on functions previously performed by damaged areas a first phase of the study assessed whether rtms had a treatment effect on pain in it the research team randomly assigned six patients to receive either sham or active rtms one week and the other treatment the next measuring pain scores before and after each session once that phase had shown that rtms did reduce the patients pain an openlabel treatment phase began in this second phase the 18 patients underwent 12 weekly rtms sessions the patients pain scores were measured just before each weekly session data were collected for eight years ending in 2014 kobayashi said that some patients really hoped to continue rtms after the study because their pain worsened after rtms treatment sessions were over and almost all the patients said that after the study ended their pain increased to the level before rtms he added that the remaining question to answer is whether the level of the patients severe uncontrollable pain would continue to decrease if rtms continued for several years weekly noninvasive brain stimulation provides longterm relief of poststroke pain
real,a new study from the university of texas medical branch at galveston has revealed that a treatment taken daily by people who have had organ transplants to prevent organ rejection protects against alzheimers disease an early online version of this paper detailing the findings has been published and is scheduled for publication in the july 7 issue of the journal of alzheimers disease alzheimers disease is the most common ageassociated neurodegenerative disorder that has no cure compelling evidence shows that toxic protein aggregates called a oligomers selectively target and disrupt the points of communication between brain cells impairing memory in people suffering from the disease because of this there is a large consensus that preventing this kind of toxicity would be an effective treatment strategy calcineurin is an enzyme that regulates communication between brain cells and memory formation the utmb research team and others have shown previously that this enzyme plays a central role in the harmful effects of the a oligomers and that elevated calcineurin is found in the nervous system of alzheimers patients using a mouse model of alzheimers the researchers earlier showed that blocking calcineurin restored memory function however the question of whether such a strategy would prevent the onset and progression of alzheimers in people is challenging because treatment with a calcineurinblocking agent suppresses the immune system to bypass this issue the utmb team analyzed data from the medical records of 2644 patients who received organ transplants and must take calcineurin inhibitorbased medications such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine for the rest of their lives to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ as part of the medical care for transplant recipients any evidence of memory impairment or dementia is immediately noted and monitored as it can limit treatment compliance among these patients the participants were separated into groups by age at the time of last visit or death gender and ethnicity eight participants showed evidence of dementia two were younger than 65 five were in the 6574 years old group and one was in the 7584 years old group the utmb study data was compared with national data obtained from the 2014 alzheimers association facts and figures dataset on agematched patients to compare the prevalence of alzheimers these data clearly show that the prevalence of dementia and alzheimers in our transplant patient group is significantly lower in fact almost absent when compared to national data from the general population said senior author luca cicalese professor in the department of surgery in patients over 65 years 11 percent of the general population had dementia compared with 102 percent of the study subjects in americans over 75 years 153 percent of the population had dementia compared with 06 percent of the study subjects among americans over 85 years 32 percent had dementia although we did not have any patients in this age group with dementia since the people involved in the study mostly come from texas the researchers further compared their over 65 years old group with the prevalence of alzheimers in the general population of the state and got similar results taken together our findings from these people confirm the data obtained with animal models and support for the first time in human subjects our notion that calcineurin inhibition has a protective effect on the development and possible progression and even reversal of alzheimers disease said senior author giulio taglialatela professor and vice chair for research in the department of neurology and director of utmbs mitchell center for neurodegenerative diseases therefore we are currently working on devising treatment strategies to obtain the same beneficial effects in ad humans using low doses of calcineurin inhibitors that result in minimal or no immunosuppression thus limiting possible undesired side effects
real,researchers have developed a score that predicts an individuals risk of dying within 5 years for people aged between 40 and 70 years old in the uk according to new research published in the lancet the score which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination such as selfrated health and usual walking speed could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status and by doctors to identify highrisk individuals for further treatment say the authors individuals can calculate their personalised 5year mortality risk and what the study authors call an ubble age 1the age where the average mortality risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individualthrough an online questionnaire using the dedicated interactive website 2 the site was developed with sense about science 3 a uk charity that that equips people to make sense of scientific and medical claims in public discussion the ubble website allows anybody in the uk between forty and seventy years old to calculate their ubble age and their risk of dying within the next five years compared to the general population using a simple set of a dozen or so questions says study coauthor professor erik ingelsson from uppsala university sweden this is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample and is not limited to specific populations single types of risk or requiring laboratory testing 4 to create the score professor ingelsson and dr andrea ganna from the karolinska institutet in sweden analysed data collected between 2006 and 2010 from nearly half a million adults aged between 40 and 70 years from the uk biobank 5 they used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic lifestyle and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes in men and women separately the results allow researchers to compare the predictive ability of a large number of healthrelated risk factors which were formerly studied separately and using different populations although the predictive ability of risk factors does not necessarily imply they are causally related to the risk of dying for example the research shows that selfreported information such as usual walking pace and illness and injuries in the past 2 years is generally a stronger predictor of death and survival than biological measurements such as pulse rate and blood pressure surprisingly selfreported walking pace is a stronger predictor of death risk in both men and women than smoking habits and other lifestyle measurements selfrated overall health 6 emerged as the single most powerful predictor of death in men and previous cancer diagnosis the strongest predictor in women see figure 1 of the article when excluding individuals with serious diseases or disorders smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality from any cause figure 3 using these findings the researchers then developed an easytocalculate risk score for an individuals risk of dying in the next 5 years based on the most predictive selfreported information including 13 questions for men and 11 for women the performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two scottish centres which were not used to develop the score and was found to have around 80 accuracy in men and women table 2 uk life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score for the overall uk population according to study coauthor dr ganna the fact that the score can be measured online in a brief questionnaire without any need for lab tests or physical examination is an exciting development we hope that our score might eventually enable doctors to quickly and easily identify their highest risk patients although more research will be needed to determine whether it can be used in this way in a clinical setting of course the score has a degree of uncertainty and shouldnt be seen as a deterministic prediction for most people a high risk of dying in the next five years can be reduced by increased physical activity smoking cessation and a healthy diet 4 writing in a linked comment simon thompson and peter willeit from the university of cambridge in the uk say one appealing aspect of the website is the representation of an individuals estimated 5 year mortality risk as what the authors call ubble age the age where the average risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual this concept is similar to that of heart age developed for communicating cardiovascular risk whether this will help individuals improve selfawareness of their health status however or only lead to socalled cyberchondria is a moot point moreover 5 year mortality is easier to predict than longterm morbidity or quality of life and life expectancy all of which are more important to individuals and to society
real,in a report on what is believed to be the first small clinical trial of its kind researchers at the johns hopkins kimmel cancer center say they have safely used immune cells grown from patients own bone marrow to treat multiple myeloma a cancer of white blood cells results of the trial involving a particular type of tumortargeting t cell known as marrowinfiltrating lymphocytes mils are described in the may 20 issue of science translational medicine what we learned in this small trial is that large numbers of activated mils can selectively target and kill myeloma cells says johns hopkins immunologist ivan borrello md who led the clinical trial mils he explains are the foot soldiers of the immune system and attack foreign cells such as bacteria or viruses but in their normal state they are inactive and too few in number to have a measurable effect on cancer previous laboratory research by borrello and his colleagues showed that activated mils could selectively target and kill myeloma cells taken from patients and grown in laboratory culture flasks for the clinical trial the johns hopkins team enrolled 25 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma although three of the patients relapsed before they could receive the mils therapy the scientists retrieved mils from each patients bone marrow grew them in the laboratory to expand their numbers activated them with microscopic beads coated with immune activating antibodies and intravenously injected each of the 22 patients with their own cells three days before the injections of expanded mils patients received high doses of chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant standard treatments for multiple myeloma one year after receiving the mils therapy 13 of the 22 patients had at least a partial response to the therapy meaning that their cancers had shrunk by at least 50 percent seven patients experienced at least a 90 percent reduction in tumor cell volume and lived on average 251 months without cancer progression the remaining 15 patients had an average of 118 progressionfree months following mils therapy none of the participants had serious side effects from the mils therapy the overall survival was 315 months for those with less than 90 percent disease reduction but this number has not yet been reached in those with better responses the average followup time is currently more than six years borrello notes that several us cancer centers have conducted similar experimental treatments known as adoptive t cell therapy but says the johns hopkins team is believed to be the only one to use mils other types of tumorinfiltrating cells can be used but they are usually less plentiful in patients tumors and may not grow as well outside the body says borrello in nonbloodbased tumors such as melanoma only about onehalf of patients have t cells in their tumors that can be harvested and only about onehalf of those harvested cells can be grown typically immune cells from solid tumors called tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes can be harvested and grown in only about 25 percent of patients who could potentially be eligible for the therapy but in our clinical trial we were able to harvest and grow mils from all 22 patients says kimberly noonan phd a research associate at the johns hopkins university school of medicine noonan says the small trial helped her and her colleagues learn more about which patients may benefit from mils therapy for example they were able to determine how many of the mils grown in the lab were specifically targeted to the patients tumor and whether they continued to target the tumor after being infused additionally the scientists found that patients whose bone marrow before treatment contained a high number of certain immune cells known as central memory cells also had better response to mils therapy patients who began treatment with signs of an overactive immune response did not respond as well noonan says the research team has used these data to guide two other ongoing mils clinical trials those studies she says are trying to extend antitumor response and tumor specificity by combining the mils transplant with a johns hopkinsdeveloped cancer vaccine called gvax and the myeloma drug lenalidomide which stimulates t cell responses the researchers say the trials also have shed light on new ways to grow the mils in most of these trials you see that the more cells you get the better response you get in patients learning how to improve cell growth may therefore improve the therapy says noonan kimmel cancer center scientists are also developing mils to treat solid tumors such as lung esophageal and gastric cancers as well as the pediatric cancers neuroblastoma and ewings sarcoma experts report there are more than 20000 new cases of multiple myeloma and more than 10000 deaths each year in united states it is the second most common cancer originating in the blood

real,scientists have developed a new hpv human papilloma virus vaccine which protects against nine types of the virus seven of which cause most cases of cervical cancer the new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine which protects against only two cancer causing types of hpv a pivotal international clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine gardasil 9 with the current vaccine gardasil in more than 14200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old the findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with gardasil 9 approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented published in the new england journal of medicine the study found that among uninfected women gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing highgrade cervical vulvar and vaginal disease caused by hpv 31 33 45 52 and 58 and was equally effective as the current gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by hpv 6 11 16 and 18 professor jack cuzick of queen mary university of london who coauthored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study and served on the trial advisory board comments this is a significant achievement the new vaccine gardasil 9 is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers eventually this will mean less screening is needed as women will have greater protection from the outset gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women however its crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 1213 as the current uk vaccine programme is doing but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 2545 as part of a screening appointment until late last year there were two available vaccines to protect against hpv related disease cervarix and gardasil the uk currently uses gardasil which protects against four hpv types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts however researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other hpv related disease and by adding five more cancer related hpv types the development of the new gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction hpv is the most common sexually transmitted virus many people infected with hpv clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk causing warts or verrucas however other types are high risk causing cervical cancer and less commonly vulvar vaginal penile anal and throat cancers almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of hpv cervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women with over 500000 cases and 250000 deaths per year worldwide in the uk around 3000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths in the uk all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered hpv vaccination as part of the nhs childhood vaccination programme professor jack cuzick concludes following these important findings this vaccine has been licenced in the usa and approval is currently being sought in the uk and other countries it is encouraging that the joint committee on vaccines and immunisation is reviewing gardasil 9 in light of this new evidence this clinical trial was funded by merck
real,among nonsmokers who had diabetes those who took the diabetes drug metformin had a decrease in lung cancer risk according to a study in cancer prevention research a journal of the american association for cancer research by lori sakoda phd mph research scientist at the kaiser permanente division of research in oakland california some laboratory studies and a number of observational studies suggest that metformin may prevent cancer but the data from human studies however are conflicting explained sakoda the researchers conducted this study to further clarify the association between metformin use and lung cancer risk sakoda and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study of 47351 diabetic patients 54 percent men 40 years or older who completed a healthrelated survey between 1994 and 1996 information on their diabetes medications was collected from electronic pharmacy records about 46 percent of them were everusers of metformin defined as those who filled two or more prescriptions within a sixmonth period during 15 years of followup 747 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer of them 80 were nonsmokers and 203 were current smokers metformin use was not associated with lower lung cancer risk overall however the risk was 43 percent lower among diabetic patients who had never smoked and the risk appeared to decrease with longer use nonsmokers who used metformin for five years or longer had a 52 percent reduction in lung cancer risk but this finding was not statistically significant metformin use for five or more years was associated with a 31 percent decrease in the risk for adenocarcinoma the most common type of lung cancer diagnosed in nonsmokers and an 82 percent increase in the risk for smallcell carcinoma a type of lung cancer often diagnosed in smokers but neither of these findings were statistically significant in an interview sakoda said metformin use was not associated with lung cancer risk when we looked at all patients with diabetes however our results suggest that risk might differ by smoking history with metformin decreasing risk among nonsmokers and increasing risk among current smokers our results suggesting that the risk associated with metformin might differ by smoking history were unexpected additional large wellconducted studies are needed to clarify whether metformin may be used to prevent lung or other cancers particularly in specific subpopulations such as nonsmokers
real,january 6 2015 it is normal for cognitive function to slightly deteriorate with age memory capacity begins to worsen along with processing speed and the ability to form longterm memories finding a way to defer the onset of these issues becomes increasingly important as life expectancy gets longer and global populations age this study conducted by researchers from italys university of laquila and mars incorporated reinforces the results of several recent cognitive studiesthrowing more light on the important role diet plays in maintaining cognitive health dr giovambattista desideri lead author on the paper said the results of this study are encouragingthey support the idea that diet and specifically a diet rich in cocoa flavanols can play an important role in maintaining cognitive health as we age this study was the second installment in a twopart investigation by this team into the effects cocoa flavanols have on the brain the first study published in the journal hypertension in 2012 found cognitive and cardiometabolic benefits of habitual cocoa flavanol consumption in older adults who had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment mci despite these findings the question of the benefits of cocoa flavanols on cognitive function among individuals without mci remained uncertain this second study just published in the ajcn looked to address this question enrolling men and women aged 6185 years with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction the participants in this controlled randomized doubleblind study were assigned to one of three flavanol groups consuming a drink containing either high 993 mg intermediate 520 mg or low 48 mg amounts of cocoa flavanols every day for eight weeks the nutritionally matched drinks were specially prepared the high and intermediateflavanol cocoa drinks were produced using mars patented cocoapro process while the lowflavanol drink was made with a highly processed alkalized cocoa powder other than the inclusion of the test drink normal diets and regular lifestyle were maintained throughout the study at the start of the study and again after eight weeks cognitive function was assessed using a battery of tests that examined memory retention recall as well as executive function among those individuals who regularly consumed either the high or intermediateflavanol drinks there were significant improvements in overall cognitive function after only eight weeks as cognitive function was normal for this aged population this study shows that even cognitively healthy individuals can quickly benefit from the regular inclusion of cocoa flavanols in their diets in addition to evaluating cognitive function the researchers also monitored insulin resistance blood pressure and other metabolic markers excitingly there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes in the high and intermediateflavanol groups both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced and insulin resistance was significantly improved in contrast only a modest improvement in diastolic blood pressure was observed in the lowflavanol group with no significant improvements in either systolic blood pressure or insulin resistance among the consumers of the lowflavanol drink it is not yet fully understood how cocoa flavanols bring about improvements in cognitive function but the studys authors suggest that the improvements in insulin resistance and blood pressure could be revealing earlier studies suggest a central role for insulin resistance in brain aging said desideri these results could therefore provide some insight into a possible mechanism of action for the cognitive improvements we have observed over the past decade there has been significant evidence indicating that consuming cocoa flavanols improves vascular function dr catherine kwikuribe human health and nutrition director at mars incorporated and coauthor on this latest study said since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function dr kwikuribe went on to speak about mars flavanol research program that has spanned over two decades the amount of research showing the beneficial effects of cocoa flavanol consumption is growing and mars is proud to be a partner in important research like this that highlights the positive role cocoa flavanols may play in supporting healthy aging dr desideri and his team are already thinking about the next steps it is clear from our latest research and other recent studies that cocoa flavanols have profound effects on the body and specifically the brain said desideri now wed like to know how they work and how long the effects last if these further studies confirm the findings that brain health can be improved by consuming dietary flavanols it may have the potential to affect the daily lives of millions of people worldwide note to editors this research trial was carried out with a special cocoa flavanol test product designed to deliver a standardized amount of flavanols within a nutritionally suitable drink this test product is currently not

real,drugs that activate brain stem cells may reverse multiple sclerosis case western reserve university illustrator megan kern two drugs already on the market an antifungal and a steroid may potentially take on new roles as treatments for multiple sclerosis according to a study published in nature today researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter which is damaged in multiple sclerosis the study was partially funded by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds part of the national institutes of health specialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons the long wires that connect brain cells myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells in multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness numbness and problems with vision coordination and balance to replace damaged cells the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cellderived tissues for regenerative medicine and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road we asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin our ultimate goal was to enhance the bodys ability to repair itself said paul j tesar phd associate professor at case western reserve school of medicine in cleveland and senior author of the study it is unknown how myelinproducing cells are damaged but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder current therapies for multiple sclerosis include antiinflammatory drugs which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis but are less effective at preventing longterm disability scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis adult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells opcs which are stem cells that generate myelinproducing cells opcs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter in the current study dr tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate opcs to increase myelination opcs have been difficult to isolate and study but dr tesar and his colleagues in collaboration with robert miller phd professor at george washington university school of medicine and health sciences in washington dc developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish using this technique they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells the compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by nihs national center for advancing translational sciences ncats all are approved for use in humans ncats and dr tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against opcs in the near future to identify other promising compounds dr tesars team found that two compounds in particular miconazole an antifungal and clobetasol a steroid stimulated mouse and human opcs into generating myelinproducing cells next they examined whether the drugs when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis could improve remyelination they found that both drugs were effective in activating opcs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis as a result almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs they also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms the ability to activate white matter cells in the brain as shown in this study opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis said ursula utz phd program director at the ninds dr tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials they are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms such as injections in humans is unknown offlabel use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms we are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use dr tesar said this work was supported by the ninds ns085246 ns030800 ns026543 the new york stem cell foundation and the myelin repair foundation new york city the ninds is the nations leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system the mission of ninds is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system

vision and preventing vision loss however one drug aflibercept provided greater improvement for people with more severe vision loss when treatment was initiated the trial was conducted by the national eye institute diabetic retinopathy clinical research network drcrnet including researchers from joslin diabetes center the results appeared in the february online edition of the new england journal of medicine diabetes is a significant risk factor for developing eye diseases the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness is diabetic retinopathy which is caused by elevated blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels of the retina and affects approximately 77 million americans about 750000 americans with diabetic retinopathy have diabetic macular edema dme in which fluid leaks into the macula the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead the fluid causes the macula to swell blurring vision dme is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in workingage adults with diabetes with the rate of diabetes increasing dramatically worldwide many individuals will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye complications and dme is a major global health concern says jennifer k sun md mph a member of the study research team and writing committee and an investigator in the section on vascular biology an ophthalmologist in beetham eye institute at joslin and an assistant professor at harvard medical school in an earlier study joslin researchers reported that vegf a major growth factor for blood vessels is elevated in the eye fluids of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and dme causing leakage and the growth of abnormal blood vessels over the past few years drugs that target vegf have become a standard treatment for dme providing a preferred alternative or adjunct to laser treatment the standard medicare perinjection costs of the three antivegf drugs evaluated in the study are about 1960 for aflibercept eylea 1200 for ranibizumab lucentis and 70 for bevacizumab avastin at the start of the trial 660 adults with dme were enrolled their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes about half of the participants had 2032 or 2040 vision and the other half had vision of 2050 or worse they were randomized into three treatment groups and received the assigned study drug by injection into the eye until the dme resolved or stabilized participants on bevacizumab and ranibizumab received on average 10 injections versus nine for those on aflibercept one year after starting treatment all participants had improved vision those with mild vision loss 2032 to 2040 at baseline in all three treatment groups gained on average almost two lines on an eye chart for participants with more severe vision loss 2050 or worse aflibercept improved vision on average nearly four lines bevacizumab about 25 lines and ranibizumab almost three lines the results clearly remove any doubts about antivegf drugs efficacy in treating dme all three drugs improved vision substantially with aflibercept showing more visual gains in patients with worse vision at the start of the trial physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options says study coauthor lloyd p aiello md phd professor of ophthalmology at harvard medical school director of joslins beetham eye institute cohead of joslins section of vascular cell biology and founding chair of the drcr network in light of these positive results it is more important than ever for patients with diabetes to be evaluated on a regular basis for eye disease and receive treatment promptly once indicated as we now have excellent success in treating patients with dme says dr aiello the trial was supported through a cooperative agreement from the national eye institute and the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases national institutes of health us
