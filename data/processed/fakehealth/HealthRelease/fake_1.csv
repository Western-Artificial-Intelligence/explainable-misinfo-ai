fake,madison wis more than 700 million adults and children worldwide are obese according to a 2017 study that called the growing number and weightrelated health problems a rising pandemic new batteryfree easily implantable weightloss devices developed by engineers at the university of wisconsinmadison could offer a promising new weapon for battling the bulge in laboratory testing the devices helped rats shed almost 40 percent of their body weight results of the study were published today dec 17 2018 in the journal nature communications measuring less than 1 centimeter across or about a third of the area of a us penny the tiny devices which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure generate gentle electric pulses from the stomachs natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve which links the brain and the stomach that gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food the pulses correlate with the stomachs motions enhancing a natural response to help control food intake says xudong wang a uwmadison professor of materials science and engineering unlike gastric bypass which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach the effects of the new devices also are reversible when wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks the studys rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on wangs device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss that existing unit maestro approved by the food and drug administration in 2015 administers highfrequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach it requires a complicated control unit and bulky batteries which frequently must be recharged that ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use says luke funk a surgery professor in uwmadisons division of minimally invasive foregut and bariatric surgery one potential advantage of the new device over existing vagus nerve stimulators is that it does not require external battery charging which is a significant advantage when you consider the inconvenience that patients experience when having to charge a battery multiple times a week for an hour or so in fact wangs device contains no batteries no electronics and no complicated wiring it relies instead on the undulations of the stomach walls to power its internal generators that means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves its automatically responsive to our body function producing stimulation when needed says wang our body knows best wang is a world expert in wearable and implantable capacitive electricitygenerating devices having previously created implantable nanogenerators that harvest energy from peoples beating hearts and breathing a motionpowered bandage for wound healing and other such devices he and his collaborators patented the weightloss device through the wisconsin alumni research foundation and are moving forward with testing in larger animal models if successful they hope to move toward human trials our expectation is that the device will be more effective and convenient to use than other technologies says wang
fake,about 3 million people in the us are diagnosed every year with bipolar disorder a psychiatric condition characterized by dramatic shifts in mood from depression to mania currently the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics however an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probioticsoften thought of as good bacteriaas a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar and other psychiatric mood disorders and a new study from baltimores sheppard pratt health system conducted by a research team led by faith dickerson finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder probiotic organisms are nonpathogenic bacteria that when present in the gut flora are known to improve the overall health of the host in recent years research has demonstrated a strong link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system this connection named the gutbrain axis gba allows for crosstalk between the endocrine immune and autonomic nervous systems the gi tract is also home to the intestinal microbiome a complex population of roughly 100 trillion microorganisms more than ten times the number of cells that make up the human body that interacts with the mucosal lining of the gi tract studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome and gi tissue has a significant effect on the gba there is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies autoimmune disorders and psychiatric mood disorders in the case of bipolar disorder and the gba previous studies have shown that inflammation or overstimulation of the bodys immune system is a contributing factor in the disease with this in mind researchers developed a probiotic supplement aimed at reducing inflammation caused by microbial imbalances in the gut a group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system the patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications the results showed that the group receiving the probiotic supplement on average didnt return to the hospital as quickly and required less inpatient treatment time compared to the placebo group the beneficial effects were most pronounced in those patients who exhibited abnormally high levels of inflammation at the beginning of the study overall these results indicate that changes in intestinal inflammation can alter the trajectory of psychiatric mood disorders and that modulating the intestinal microbiota may be a new avenue of treatment for patients suffering from these diseases

fake,newswise dec 7 2018vitamin c may reduce the harm done to lungs in infants born to mothers who smoke during their pregnancy according to a randomized controlled trial published online in the american thoracic societys american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine in oral vitamin c 500 mgday to pregnant smokers improves infant airway function at 3 months a randomized trial cindy t mcevoy md mcr and her coauthors report that at three months of age the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin c in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows fefs fefs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction the researchers also discovered an association between the infant fefs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born other studies have linked this genetic factor specifically for the 5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease smoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations said dr mcevoy lead study author and professor of pediatrics at oregon health science university finding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed in a previous study the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin c 500 mgday during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo that study used passive methods to measure lung function and the authors note that fefs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children in the current study 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin c 125 women or a placebo 126 women smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week all participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study the researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid a component of vitamin c available to the body at the time they enrolled in the study the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin c to become comparable to women who do not smoke infants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes the authors believe that future trials of vitamin c supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves summing up the findings of the current study dr mcevoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin c may present a safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide however she added helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials although vitamin c supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy those children will still be at greater risk for obesity behavioral disorders and other serious health issues she said this study was funded by the national heart lung and blood institute and the office of dietary supplements

fake,research on a bacterial toxin first discovered in adelaide has led to the development a new blood test for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer a disease which kills over 1000 australian women and 150000 globally each year the new blood test has the potential to dramatically improve early detection of the disease although it will require further testing before it is available for clinicians a research team from the university of adelaide and griffith university have been studying the interactions between the toxin and an abnormal glycan sugar expressed on the surface of human cancer cells and released into the blood the team has now engineered a harmless portion of the toxin to enhance its specificity for the cancer glycan and used this to detect it in blood samples from women with ovarian cancer a paper published this month in biochemical and biophysical research communications has shown that the new test detected significant levels of the cancer glycan in blood samples from over 90 of women with stage 1 ovarian cancer and in 100 of samples from later stages of the disease but not in any of the samples from healthy controls ovarian cancer is notoriously difficult to detect in its early stages when there are more options for treatment and survival rates are better our new test is therefore a potential game changer says professor james paton director of the university of adelaides research centre for infectious diseases professor michael jennings deputy director of the institute for glycomics at griffith university said detection of this tumour marker may also play a role in a simple liquid biopsy to monitor disease stage and treatment the team is currently seeking scientific and commercial partners to further test the technology with larger numbers of patient samples and to adapt it for mass screening
fake,rockville md november 15 2018hot water treatment may help improve inflammation and blood sugar glucose levels in people who are unable to exercise according to a new study the findings are published ahead of print in the journal of applied physiology physical stress such as exercise can cause the shortterm elevation of inflammatory markers after exercise the level of an inflammatory chemical il6 rises in a process called the inflammatory response this activates the release of antiinflammatory substances to combat unhealthily high levels of inflammation known as chronic lowgrade inflammation recent research has shown that raising body temperature augments the inflammatory response and provides a rationale for identifying exercise alternatives that reduce lowgrade inflammation in the body previous studies have also found a connection between a spike in body temperature and nitric oxide production a substance that aids blood flow and helps carry glucose throughout the body researchers studied markers of inflammation and blood sugar and insulin levels in a group of sedentary overweight men the volunteers participated in both hotwater immersion and ambient room temperature control trials separated by at least three days the researchers took blood samples before and after the participants rested in an 80degree f room for 15 minutes after the rest period the participants either remained seated in the room or entered a hotwater bath for 60 minutes in the hot water trial the volunteers sat immersed up to their necks in 102degree f water the research team measured the mens heart rate blood pressure and body temperature every 15 minutes throughout both the control and immersion conditions blood samples were taken again two hours after each session the researchers found that a single hotwater immersion session causes the elevation of il6 levels in the blood and increased nitric oxide production but did not change the expression of heat shock protein 72another protein suggested to be important for health however a twoweek treatment period in which the men participated in daily hotwater baths showed a reduction of fasting blood sugar and insulin levels as well as improved lowgrade inflammation at rest the men reported a level of discomfort during the hot water immersion trial which could be due to the high temperature of the water or the length of time they were required to remain immersed the researchers acknowledge that these conditions may make it difficult for people to commit to this type of alternative treatment however the positive results of decreased inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity suggest that hotwater immersion may improve aspects of the inflammatory profile and enhance glucose metabolism in sedentary overweight males and might have implications for improving metabolic health in populations unable to meet the current physical activity recommendations the researchers wrote

inhibitors icis the study from the university of texas md anderson cancer center which includes two patients suggests fecal microbiota transplantation fmt is worth investigating in clinical trials as a therapy for this common side effect of immunotherapy the research led by yinghong wang md phd assistant professor of gastroenterology hepatology nutrition and director of medication induced colitis and enteritis was published today in nature medicine the resolution of colitis in these patients can be confirmed clinically and endoscopically after fmt treatment said wang based on these results this should be evaluated even as a firstline therapy for iciassociated colitis because its safe quick and the effect is durable from one treatment immune checkpoint inhibitors which release a block on the immune system to attack cancer have been successful in providing durable responses for patients with several cancer types however these treatments are often associated with significant immunerelated toxicities colitis inflammation of the colon is the second most common side effect from icis occurring in up to 40 percent of patients explained wang when iciassociated colitis is severe guidelines require a patient to stop ici treatment until the colitis is in remission if the patient is a good responder to immunotherapy that means youve taken their effective treatment away said wang we have a limited amount of time to fix the problem so they can resume ici treatment but i feel that weve made great progress in this area the researchers chose to investigate the potential for fmt as an alternative compassionateuse therapy for patients suffering from refractory or unresponsive iciassociated colitis the two patients included in the study were treated at md anderson between june 2017 and january 2018 fmt has shown promise in treating other types of gastrointestinal diseases such as recurrent clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease ibd which shares many clinical and molecular characteristics with iciassociated colitis these conditions typically are treated with steroids and targeted immunosuppressive agents which result in additional severe side effects and can counteract the effects of immunotherapy both patients in the study had a complete resolution of their colitis following treatment with fmt the first patients colitis resolved within two weeks following a single fmt treatment the second patient experienced a partial recovery after the first treatment followed by complete recovery after a second fmt with endoscopic evaluation before and after treatment both patients displayed significant improvements in inflammation and ulcerations including a reduction of inflammatory immune cells pre and posttreatment stool analyses revealed patients gut microbiomes to be most similar to the donor immediately after treatment with less resemblance to the donor over time still posttreatment gut bacteria remained distinct from their own pretreatment microbiome additionally distinct new populations of bacterial species were evident in these patients following fmt compared to pretreatment samples including several species known to be protective or reduce inflammation the authors acknowledge significant limitations to this study based on the very small cohort and they plan to pursue clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of fmt in treating iciassociated colitis as compared with standard immunosuppressive therapy fmt continues to be offered to md anderson patients on a compassionateuse basis previous md anderson research showed that bacteria in the gut influence patient response to ici therapy and other evidence suggests modifying the microbiome in mice can alter their response to immunotherapy the current data further suggests there is the potential for many molecular studies to better understand the role of the microbiome in driving icicolitis and immunotherapy response more broadly the study

fake,men who eat plenty of fermented dairy products have a smaller risk of incident coronary heart disease than men who eat less of these products according to a new study from the university of eastern finland a very high consumption of nonfermented dairy products on the other hand was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease the findings were published in the british journal of nutrition earlier studies have shown that fermented dairy products have more positive effects on blood lipid profiles and on the risk of heart disease than other dairy products examples of fermented dairy products include cheese yoghurt quark kefir and sour milk however research into the topic remains scarce the kuopio ischaemic heart disease risk factor study ongoing at the university of eastern finland explored the associations of fermented and nonfermented dairy products with the risk of incident coronary heart disease approximately 2000 men participated in the study their dietary habits were assessed at the beginning of the study in 19841989 and they were followed up for an average of 20 years during this followup 472 men experienced an incident coronary heart disease event the study participants were divided into groups on the basis of how much they ate different dairy products and the researchers compared the groups with the highest and lowest consumption while also taking various lifestyle and nutrition factors into consideration when the study participants were divided into four groups on the basis of their consumption of fermented dairy products with less than 35 fat the risk of incident coronary heart disease was 26 lower in the highest consumption group compared to the lowest consumption group sour milk was the most commonly used lowfat fermented dairy product the consumption of highfat fermented dairy products such as cheese was not associated with the risk of incident coronary heart disease however the researchers found that a very high consumption on nonfermented dairy products was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease milk was the most commonly used product in this category and a very high consumption was defined as an average daily milk intake of 09 litres lower consumption levels were not associated with the risk here in finland peoples habits of consuming different dairy products have changed over the past decades for instance the consumption of milk and sour milk have declined while many fermented dairy products such as yoghurt quark and cheeses have gained in popularity adjunct professor jyrki virtanen from the university of eastern finland says the new study provides further evidence on the health benefits that fermented dairy products may have over nonfermented ones all the mechanisms are not understood yet but they may be linked to compounds forming during the fermentation process
fake,scientists at the university of york have found a way of distinguishing between fatal prostate cancer and manageable cancer which could reduce unnecessary surgeries and radiotherapy a recent study showed that more than 25 men were being unnecessarily treated with surgery or radiotherapy for every single life saved it is believed that success rates could be hindered as a result of treating all prostate cancers in the same way a team at the university of york and the university of british columbia canada however have designed a test that can pick out lifethreatening prostate cancers with up to 92 accuracy professor norman maitland from the university of yorks department of biology said unnecessary prostate treatment has both physical consequences for patients and their families but is also a substantial financial burden on the nhs where each operation will cost around 10000 cancers that are contained in the prostate however have the potential to be actively monitored which is not only cheaper but has far fewer negative sideeffects in patients with nonlife threatening cancer it is now understood that to find the different levels of cancer scientists have to identify genes that have been altered in different cancer types the team analysed more than 500 cancer tissue samples and compared them with noncancer tissue to search for patterns of a chemical group that is added to part of the dna molecule altering gene expression a persons age what they eat and how they sleep for example impacts on chemical alterations to genes and which ones are turned on and off this is part of the normal functioning of the human body and can tell individuals apart but the process can sometimes go wrong resulting in various diseases professor maitland said in some diseases such as cancer genes can be switched to an opposite state causing major health issues and threat to life the challenge in prostate cancer is how to look at all of these patterns within a cell but hone in on the gene activity that suggests cancer and not only this what type of cancer dangerous or manageable to put it another way how to do we distinguish the tiger cancer cells from the pussycat cancer cells when there are millions of patterns of chemical alterations going on many of which will be perfectly healthy the team needed to eliminate the noise of the genetic patterns that make individuals unique to leave them with the patterns that indicate cancer they were able to do this using a computer algorithm which left the team with 17 possible genetic markers for prostate cancer dr davide pellacani who began these studies in york before moving to the university of british columbia said using this computer analysis not only could we see which tissue samples had cancer and which didnt but also which cancers were dangerous and which ones less so out of almost a million markers studied we were able to use our new tools to single out differences in cancer potency to take this method out of the laboratory the team are now investigating a further trial with new cancer samples and hope to involve a commercial partner to allow this to be used for patients being treated in the nhs
fake,uk researchers behind a potential universal liquid biopsy blood test for cancer detection have licensed the technology to an industrial partner to take it to market the research team believes that the test could be the first screening tool to rule in or rule out cancer in patients under suspicion of the disease alongside other traditional diagnostics methods the test was developed at the university of bradford uk it measures the damage to the dna of white blood cells when subjected to different intensities of ultraviolet uv light revealing measurable differences in the cells susceptibility to further damage in patients with cancer the damage forms a comet tail of dna pieces that are pulled towards the positive end of an electric field the longer the comet tail the more dna damage is present which correlates with the presence of cancer in a 2014 proof of concept study the bradford researchers showed they could identify which samples were from patients with three different types of cancer even those who had yet to be diagnosed with 93 per cent success however in their two most recent clinical trials of the test involving over 700 blood samples from colorectal and prostate cancer patients and further breast and lung cancer samples that were available they were unable to distinguish those with cancer from healthy patients in 60 cases to determine whether scoring more cells on the slides would explain this challenging subgroup lead researcher professor diana anderson from the university of bradford asked imstar to reanalyse the inconclusive slides the bradford team had scored 100 cells per slide but the pathfinder system is able to analyse up to 10000 cells per slide and uses artificial intelligence concepts in its proprietary software scoring a minimum of 2000 cells per slide the imstar pathfinder system was able to separate all individuals of the cancer group from the healthy control group with confirmed statistical significance these findings are published in faseb bioadvances journal professor anderson said this test is different from other universal cancer tests being developed because it is not looking for a specific biomarker or mutation this is a generic test for cancer in an individual regardless of the underlying mechanism thats causing their cancer im now convinced that if we used the powerful imstar system to look at thousands of cells on all the slide samples in the trials we would see a significant increase in the overall predictability beyond the original 93 per cent of the original 2014 study parisbased company imstar has now coupled the innovative technology developed at bradford with their fullyautomated pathfinder cell readeranalyser to create a powerful and robust test for early detection called tumorscan cofirst author dr mojgan najafzadeh from the university of bradford said we feel that weve taken it as far as we can in proving that the test works with high predictability for cancer outcome and imstar are the right partners to improve it still further dr francoise soussaline phd dsc imstars president said to bring a universal liquid biopsy blood test for cancer to market it must achieve a number of criteria including high sensitivity and specificity and be fully automated with high throughput for a medical routine use in addition test results must be available in 24hrs and at affordable cost we believe that the combination of bradfords innovation and imstars unique expertise has shown that tumorscan can achieve these requisites imstars vicepresident for medical applications dr michel soussaline confirmed that the company will be working to automate the full test workflow further to take it to market

fake,newswise baltimore md oct 8 2018 the maryland proton treatment center mptc is now offering deeptissue external thermal therapy in combination with highprecision protonbeam radiotherapy as a potential way to boost survival chances for certain cancer patients mptc is the only center in the world to offer these two treatments at the same facility an advantage to patients because these therapies are typically given within an hour of each other research has shown that thermal therapy can be especially useful in difficulttoreach cancers in the abdomen and pelvic region studies have found that adding thermal therapy to standard treatments can significantly shrink tumors and can improve survival for some patients external thermal therapy or hyperthermia in the range of 104 up to 110 f sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in addition heat has been shown to enhance antitumor immune response we are very pleased to be able to offer deeptissue thermal therapy which can be combined with standard radiation therapy as well as protonbeam therapy to enhance the cancerkilling effects of the radiation says zeljko vujaskovic md phd a professor of radiation oncology and director of the division of translational radiation sciences dtrs in the department of radiation oncology at the university of maryland school of medicine umsom early research suggests that adding thermal therapy to protonbeam therapy may be associated with an even greater benefit than when combined with standard radiation therapy and we are excited to be at the forefront of making this combination therapy available to cancer patients says dr vujaskovic an internationally recognized expert in hyperthermic oncology proton therapy is a precise form of radiation therapy that deposits all of its energy within the tumor and allows for less irradiation of noncancerous tissue mptc which is affiliated with the university of maryland marlene and stewart greenebaum comprehensive cancer center umgccc at the university of maryland medical center is the only proton treatment center in maryland radiation oncologists at umgccc already use external thermal therapy to treat a range of cancers but do not currently use it for cancers that are deeper in the body according to dr vujaskovic the new deeptissue thermal therapy equipment which is made by pyrexar will be used to treat cancers of the abdominal and pelvic region including cancer of the bladder rectum cervix ovaries pancreas and connective tissue which are known as sarcomas patients would typically receive the thermal therapy two times a week for an hour before or after they receive standard photon radiation or protonbeam therapy the system heats the tumor tissue to 108 f with internal and external probes that enable doctors to continuously monitor the temperature a waterfilled applicator is placed over the area to be treated and noninvasive radio frequency energy is directed at the tumor the heat causes the blood vessels in the tumor to dilate bringing more oxygen into the tumor which makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy the acquisition of the deeptissue thermal therapy system was made possible by donations from jack and emily howell and the middendorf foundation inc within the department of radiation oncology and throughout our cancer center we strive to make every available tool in the cancerfighting toolbox available to our patients says william f regine md facr facro the isadore fannie schneider foxman endowed chair and professor of radiation oncology at umsom and chair of radiation oncology at umgccc by continuing to develop a comprehensive thermal oncology program we are giving patients more effective treatment options and therefore another reason to hope for

fake,washington dc september 18 2018 an international team of researchers has successfully deployed a zika virus vaccine to target and kill human glioblastoma brain cancer stem cells which had been transplanted into mice in a study published this week in mbio an openaccess journal of the american society for microbiology the team shows that a live attenuated version of the zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer glioblastoma kills about 15000 adults in the us each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery radiation and chemotherapy scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells called glioblastoma stem cells gscs which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies during the zika epidemic we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers says peiyong shi a virologist at university of texas medical branch in galveston he coled the current study with tumor biologist jianghong man of the national center of biomedical analysis in beijing and virologist chengfeng qin of the chinese academy of military medical sciences in beijing we made the connection that perhaps zika virus could also specifically infect the gscs because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells says man in previous work shi and his collaborators at washington university in st louis showed that zika virus did indeed attack and kill gscs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma in addition the zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated healthy brain cells image transmission electron micrograph of zika virus niaid if we could find a way to specifically target those gscs that are the source of recurrence then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure says qin the teams first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells shis lab has developed a promising liveattenuated zika vaccine candidate called zikvlav that had been shown to be safe nonvirulent and effective in protecting against infection in mice and nonhuman primates the zikvlav has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently when the team injected this zikvlav into the brains of mice they saw no health effects on the mice no weight loss and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite depression lethargy or selfinjury the mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function next the team wanted to show whether the zikalav could work to infect and kill human patientderived gscs in a mouse model so they mixed gscs from two different human patient donors with the zikalav and injected the mixture into the brains of mice mice that got the injection of the gscs only rapidly developed tumors mice that got the zikvlav injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development coimplanting the virus along with the gscs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received gscs alone qin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to let the viruses hunt down the gscs and eliminate them finally the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified zika virus used to kill the gscs they took gscs treated with the zikvlav and those gscs not treated and sequenced all the rna messages being expressed in these two cell populations comparing those profiles the team found that in the treated cells the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells which induced inflammation and eventually cell death next the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the zikvlav in glioblastoma patients they may also modify the zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine for example man explains the researchers could add an immune modulator as a cargo in the viral genome then once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patients systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells as a virologist i see that we should take advantage of the bad side of viruses says shi they should have a role to play in cancer treatment

fake,rehovot israel sept 6 2018 prnewswire nucleix ltd a leading cancer detection company announced today positive results from a clinical study designed to evaluate its innovative lung epicheck a blood test for early detection of lung cancer the results will be presented in a poster presentation titled lung epicheck results of the training and test sets of a methylationbased blood test for early detection of lung cancer at the iaslc 19th world conference on lung cancer hosted by the international association for the study of lung cancer to take place on september 2226 2018 in toronto canada in the study blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in europe and israel the samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the lung epicheck blood test lung epicheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls results show specificity of 91 and a sensitivity of 74 with an area under the curve auc of 89 these results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls in particular in the nonsmallcell lung carcinoma group n162 the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85 of lung cancer patients lung epicheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70 of patients with a correct identification of 59 of stage i patients 77 of stage ii 76 of stage iii and 83 of stage iv patients in the small cell lung cancer group n13 lung epicheck was able to identify correctly 92 of the patients with a sensitivity of 100 in the limited stage and 86 at the extensive stage lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages stated prof mina gaga the president of the european respiratory society ers and a lead investigator in the study clearly we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide at the moment lowdose computerized tomography ldct screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large nlst study is only reimbursed in the us for highrisk individuals ldct screening is not reimbursed in europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early operable stages for the entire atrisk population so currently not only ct screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested i am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study showing that epicheck has the ability to identify both nonsmallcell and smallcell lung cancer at early stages with a high level of sensitivity and specificity such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5year survival from about 15 to about 5070 this will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer we are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer said opher shapira phd ceo of nucleix furthermore these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort currently early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally when testing for other conditions or by using lowdose ct scans which are costly carry associated risks such as high radiation and are employed only for a very highrisk population early detection of lung cancer can be a gamechanger in the fight against this devastating disease and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the us europe and china next year in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price about lung epicheck the lung epicheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms the technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in dna methylation patterns a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body dying tumor cells release cellfree dna cfdna into the blood where cancerspecific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage the lung epicheck blood test detects changes in dna methylation in 6 markers in cfdna associated with lung cancer about lung cancer lung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types it is estimated that there are about 18 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 155 million die from the disease each year the reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic which is usually at late stages of the disease to date there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer bringing 5year survival rate to approximately 15 in addition there is a welldefined risk group for developing the disease mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50 in the us lowdose ct is available for screening of individuals 5579 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years which represent less than half of the lung cancer population therefore a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival about nucleix nucleix ltd develops manufactures and markets innovative

fake,a translational research team led by the national university of singapore nus has harnessed curateai a powerful artificial intelligence ai platform to successfully treat a patient with advanced cancer completely halting disease progression this new development represents a big step forward in personalised medicine in this clinical study a patient with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer mcrpc was given a novel drug combination consisting of investigational drug zen3694 and enzalutamide an approved prostate cancer drug the research team successfully utilised curateai to continuously identify the optimal doses of each drug to result in a durable response allowing the patient to resume a completely normal and active lifestyle dynamic dosing in cancer therapy is not commonly used in fact drug dosing changes in oncology are typically performed only to reduce toxicity curateai uniquely modifies drug dosing to increase efficacy our clinical study has shown that dosing can profoundly affect the efficacy and safety of treatment a patients clinical profile changes over time the unique ability for curateai to rapidly identify the drug doses that result in the best possible treatment outcomes allows for actionable and perpetually optimised personalised medicine explained professor dean ho director of the singapore institute for neurotechnology sinapse at nus who led the study combating cancer with combination therapy combination therapy represents a cornerstone in modern cancer treatment using this approach multiple drugs are used to attack the processes that support cancer growth a primary objective when designing combination therapies is to achieve drug synergy where the drugs work together to substantially improve efficacy while combination therapy has generally improved treatment outcomes such as overall survival for many cancers it is predominantly given at both fixed as well as high doses prof ho added patients respond to chemotherapy differently from one another even a single patients response to therapy can vary substantially over the course of treatment in fact many patients do not respond at all to the drug combination because the dosages which can profoundly impact efficacy are not suitable for them therefore while fixed dose combination therapy represents a standard of care it may also serve as a barrier to realising truly optimal and personalised medicine harnessing ai to continuously optimise combination therapy dosing to overcome the challenges of conventional combination therapy the nus team of engineers developed the curateai platform which uses the patients own clinical data such as their drug doses and corresponding changes to tumour sizes or levels of cancer biomarkers in the blood to calibrate his or her unique response to treatment this calibration is then used to create an individualised curateai profile or map that identifies the drug doses which enable the best possible treatment outcome at any given point in time no two patients profiles are alike and as a patients body and the cancer itself evolve during treatment the curateai profile evolves as well enabling the clinical and engineering teams to optimise care for the entire duration of treatment an unprecedented advance for combination therapy prof ho explained in this study which was conducted at the ucla institute of urologic oncology for a period of over a year a patient with metastatic prostate cancer was given zen3694 and enzalutamide reducing the level of prostate specific antigen psa in the patients blood served as the primary biomarker to determine if the patient was responding to treatment computed tomography ct imaging of the cancer lesions monitored the extent of disease progression initially the doses of zen3694 and enzalutamide were adjusted by the clinicians to better manage patientreported quality of life the patients initial drug doses and psa levels were then used to construct his personalised curateai profile remarkably curateai subsequently identified a zen3694 dose that was 50 per cent lower than the patients starting dose of the drug prior to curateai analysis prospective dosage guidance by curateai resulted in the lowest psa levels observed for the patient during the course of the study as treatment progressed slight increases in zen3694 dosing resulted in clear decreases in psa levels also demonstrating its key role in suppressing the metastatic cancer ct imaging of the patients lesions showed that disease progression was halted as a result of curateaiguided combination therapy of both zen3694 and enzalutamide patient care guided by curateai is currently ongoing using curateai to dynamically modify drug doses and successfully treat a metastatic cancer patient represents a landmark breakthrough for the use of ai to truly personalise patient care this advance is expected to dramatically improve response rates for all combination therapies that are being developed for oncology as well as virtually all other diseases we can also expect curateai to markedly reduce the costs of drug development prof ho added dr allan pantuck the lead clinician of the study added with fixed dose therapy patients are often switched to other drugs when they no longer respond to treatment however curateai has shown that patients can still respond to the therapies that have seemingly stopped working by continuously identifying the patients optimal dosing parameters the implementation of curateai represents a gamechanging shift in the way that combination therapy can be optimised at the single patient level and we have shown that nof1 medicine can be a reality we are excited that curateai could ultimately enhance patient accessibility to important new combination therapies saving lives in the process said prof ho who is also from the biomedical engineering and pharmacology departments at nus as well as a member of the biomedical institute for global health research and technology bigheart at nus the research was conducted in collaboration with the university of california los angeles and zenith epigenetics the findings were published in advanced therapeutics on 29 august 2018 more clinical trials underway curateai is applicable to all diseases and all patients and a first generation of the platform was previously validated in the clinic for single drug optimisation in posttransplant immunosuppression this new study demonstrates that curateai can optimise multidrug regimens multiple clinical trials using curateaiguided combination therapy for oncology and additional applications such as posttransplant immunosuppression are underway in addition patient recruitment for additional oncology trials in singapore has been approved the curateai team expects to broadly deploy the platform for the prevention of transplant rejection adult and paediatric cancers cardiovascular medicine diabetes management

fake,heart scans for patients with chest pains could save thousands of lives in the uk research suggests the lifesaving scans helped to spot those with heart disease so they could be given treatments to prevent heart attacks researchers say current guidelines should be updated to incorporate the scans into routine care the scotheart study tracked more than 4000 patients who were referred to a hospital clinic with symptoms of angina a condition that restricts the blood supply to the heart half of the patients were given a scan called a computed tomography angiogram or cta in addition to standard diagnostic tests after receiving the scan the number of patients suffering a heart attack within five years dropped by 40 per cent the study found the number of patients undergoing additional procedures increased within the first year but had levelled out by the end of the fiveyear period this suggests that including the scans in routine care would not lead to a surge in costly tests or additional heart surgery the researchers say patients who are at risk of a heart attack are frequently diagnosed with a test called an angiogram this involves inserting tubes into the body and heart to check the flow of blood and identify any obstructions that could pose a heart attack risk cta scans enable doctors to look at the blood vessels from the outside the body without the need to insert tubes into the heart the scans are cheaper quicker and safer than angiograms the study had previously found that around a quarter of patients had their diagnoses reclassified after receiving the scan prompting new treatments in many cases this is the first study to look at the impact of the scans on longterm survival rates lead researcher professor david newby of the bhf centre for cardiovascular science at the university of edinburgh said this relatively simple heart scan ensures that patients get the right treatment this is the first time that ct guided management has been shown to improve patient outcomes with a major reduction in the future risk of heart attacks this has major implications for how we now investigate and manage patients with suspected heart disease
fake,isnes belgium aug 13 2018 prnewswire volitionrx limited nyse american vnrx volition today announced preliminary data from a prospective multicentered proof of concept study of 84 men into the utility of volitions nuq assays to diagnose men with highgrade prostate cancer volition panel psa alone 94 33 at 88 specificity the volition panel of five assays including psa identified 94 of highgrade prostate cancers that require treatment as defined by gleason score1 this compares with just 33 identified by prostatespecific antigen psa alone this is a very exciting outcome for us as we continue the development of our assays beyond colorectal cancer the preliminary data from this study showed that volitions panel of assays identified men with potentially lethal highgrade prostate cancer with much greater accuracy than psa alone based on this data we believe that this test could assist clinicians in more accurate patient selection for prostate biopsy and treatment and substantially reduce the amount of unnecessary procedures in men with lowgrade tumors or no tumor the next step is to confirm these statistically significant findings in independent larger clinical trials said dr jake micallef chief scientific officer at volition prostate cancer pca is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the us after lung cancer2 currently pca is diagnosed through medical history physical examination and by elevated levels of psa in the blood men suspected of pca are given a prostate biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer however most men with elevated psa levels referred for prostate biopsy either have no cancer or have lowgrade cancer which needs monitoring but not treatment in the proof of concept study a blood sample was taken prospectively from men referred for prostate biopsy in three belgian hospitals the men were grouped by biopsy findings as having no cancer most of whom had elevated psa levels lowgrade cancer or highgrade cancer the samples were tested with a panel of five assays psa two nuq assays and two inflammatory biomarkers the assay results correlated with the gleason score which is one of the main predictors for aggressive pca determined on biopsy this suggests the assays may provide better risk stratification than that available using psa tests for men with actual or suspected pca leading to better patient management and fewer unnecessary biopsies commenting on the results principal investigator professor thierry roumeguere head of urological services erasme hospital brussels belgium said a noninvasive test to help in the risk stratification of men with suspected or actual prostate cancer will be a major step forward in the management of this disease the correlation of the panel blood test results with gleason score shows great promise in this regard we will further investigate the data in relation to disease stage as well as additional factors used for pretreatment risk stratification cameron reynolds chief executive officer at volition commented this small trial is important because it helps demonstrate once more the potential breadth of our technology if these results are validated in larger

fake,lansing mich august 7 2018 montmorency tart cherries may play a role in improving gut health suggests a firstofits kind human trial of nine adults combined with a parallel laboratory study published in the journal of nutritional biochemistry an international team of scientists found that montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract the microbiome has been the focus of multiple studies in recent years due to its potential role in maintaining digestive health as well as its impact on immunity heart health blood sugar control weight management and even brain health the gut microbiome holds great promise especially related to personalized nutrition although the research is still evolving and larger longterm human intervention studies are needed however the new study does suggest that montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gutfriendly foods while previous studies on montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits the researchers speculate that it may be due to the polyphenols anthocyanins and other flavonoids in montmorency tart cherries the varietal of tart cherries grown in the us polyphenols in plantbased foods are broken down by microbes to stimulate growth of good bacteria montmorency tart cherries were a logical food to study due to their unique composition of polyphenols including chlorogenic acids said principal investigator franck carbonero phd assistant professor in the department of food science at the university of arkansas our results suggest that the unique polyphenol mixture in tart cherries may help positively shape the gut microbiome which could potentially have farreaching health implications research methodology researchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome in the human trial nine healthy adults 2330 years old drank 8 ounces of montmorency tart cherry juice from concentrate daily for five days these individuals were nonsmokers and had not taken antibiotics which can affect the microbiome in the 12 weeks prior and during the study using stool samples the participants microbiome was analyzed before and after the dietary intervention and food frequency questionnaires were used to evaluate their overall diet the laboratory experiments were set up to mimic the conditions within the human digestive system specifically the stomach small intestine and three regions of the colon to study how polyphenols are broken down and absorbed this process of breakdown and absorption can have a significant impact on the bodys ability to use the beneficial bioactive compounds in plantbased foods the researchers tested usgrown montmorency tart cherries european tart cherries sweet cherries apricots and isolated polyphenols in each simulated region of the digestive tract they analyzed changes in the mix of bacteria and how these bacteria helped digest the polyphenols over time study results in the human trial the microbiome was positively altered primarily measured by the increase in good bacteria after just five days of drinking montmorency tart cherry concentrate although there were strikingly different responses due to the participants initial microbiome composition individuals who ate a more western diet low in fruits vegetables and fiber potentially had a lower ability to metabolize polyphenols thereby reducing bioavailability and any potential health benefits in the tart cherries remarkably in these subjects instead of bifidobacterium collinsella were the beneficial polyphenoldegrading bacteria stimulated the individuals who ate a more plantbased diet with higher intakes of carbohydrates and fiber responded with an increase in bacteroides and bifidobacterium presumably because of the specific combination of polysaccharides and polyphenols while more research is needed these results suggest individuals consuming a more plantbased diet may have a mix of gut bacteria that responds more positively andor rapidly to tart cherry consumption individuals consuming a more western diet that is lower in carbohydrates and fiber may have a lowerdifferent ability to metabolize polyphenols thereby altering bioavailability and any potential health benefits the laboratory experiments found that pure polyphenols characteristics of tart cherries increased the amount of bifidobacterium however when concentrated juices were fermented this bifidogenic effect appeared to be leveled out by the larger increase of polysaccharides utilizing bacteria somewhat surprisingly carbonero said chemistry analyses showed that tart cherries polyphenols were not completely converted to smaller phenolic metabolites suggesting that the full diversity of bacterial species in the human gut is required for efficient breakdown of the polyphenols in tart cherries while the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health montmorency tart cherries are the most common variety of tart cherries grown in the us and are available yearround in dried frozen canned and juice forms including juice concentrate which was the form used in this human trial montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate can be mixed with water or other juices it can also be consumed straight from the bottle or used as an ingredient in recipes such as smoothies and other beverages
fake,irvine calif aug 2 2018 prnewswire mdxhealth sa otc mdxhfbr today announces that a new study validates the costeffectiveness of the selectmdx for prostate cancer test a noninvasive urinebased liquid biopsy test that helps identify patients at increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer the selectmdx test can help predict the likelihood that clinically significant prostate cancer will be found by a biopsy the study published in the journal of urology led by researchers at the vanderbilt university medical center was designed to elucidate the costeffectiveness of selectmdx in a population of us men with elevated psa a marker of prostate cancer risk researchers analyzed the impact of utilizing the noninvasive diagnostic test prior to prostate biopsy the primary objective was to characterize changes in health outcomes measured in qualityadjusted life years and a secondary objective was evaluating healthcare costs the researchers found that incorporating selectmdx resulted in an average gain of 0045 life years or approximately 16 days in full health gained at a costsavings of 1694 for each patient undergoing biopsy extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311879 patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in 14035 life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than 500 million for each cohort this study demonstrated that routine use of selectmdx to guide biopsy decisionmaking improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of us men said dr matthew resnick from the departments of urologic surgery and health policy at vanderbilt university medical center nashville tn we believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment

fake,every year in europe three million people are admitted into hospitals for suspected mild traumatic brain injury mtbi cases yet 90 of these patients will be able to return home safely as no trauma has been detected today the only reliable diagnosis is the ct scan which is only available in some hospitals and in addition to being expensive exposes patients to radiations researchers from the university of geneva unige in collaboration with the hospitals of barcelona madrid and seville have developed a small device pointofcare test poct that analyses the level of proteins in the blood and allows using a single drop of blood to diagnose the possibility of a mild traumatic brain injury this discovery described in plos one will not only relieve emergency departments free patients from often long waits but also save on costly medical examinations falling whilst skiing tumbling down the stairs or getting hit on the head can cause symptoms such as blurred vision vomiting loss of consciousness or memory for about 30 minutes there is then a risk of mild cerebral trauma which represents more than 90 of brain injuries admitted to hospitals but is there really a brain lesion or are these symptoms merely the consequence of the violence of the shock of which will ultimately only leave a bump behind today the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a ct scan an expensive examination that sends xrays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma as their case is not a priority it often takes a long time for the majority of patients to return home without risk of sequelae except for bad memories find biomarkers for light traumas we wondered if it was possible to isolate certain proteins whose presence in the blood increases in the event of mild traumatic brain injury explains jeancharles sanchez professor at the department of internal medicine of specialties and the biomarkers centre of the faculty of medicine of the unige our idea was to find a way to do a quick examination that would allow during a boxing or american football match for example to determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization the opposite of the ct scan an exam that lasts a long time and cannot be done anywhere he adds during a shock on the head some brain cells are damaged and release the proteins they contain increasing their level in the blood scientists at unige and spanish hospitals then compared the blood of patients admitted for mild traumatic brain injury but diagnosed as negative with that of patients actually suffering from a brain lesion using proteomic analyses which can quantify thousands of proteins simultaneously and observe variations in their levels in the blood they gradually isolated four molecules indicating the presence of a brain injury hfabp interleukin10 s100b and gfap we have noticed that the hfabp level alone makes it possible to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one third of patients admitted after a shock enthuses jeancharles sanchez the rest of the patients will have to undergo a ct scan to confirm the diagnosis tbicheck the light brain trauma detector it was still necessary to develop a device that could be used everywhere quickly and simply and that could be available in pharmacies or sports halls when a person has an accident in the mountain few practices can do a ct scan notes the geneva researcher his team has developed a rapid diagnostic test poct called tbicheck inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma namely whether or not his hfabp level is higher than 25 nanograms per millilitre of blood if a lane appears the injured person must go to a hospital for a ct scan if there is nothing he can go home safely jeancharles sanchez says in case of doubt when reading the result a small reader the cube reader can be installed on tbicheck it will display the word positive or negative and send the result to the patients or caregivers smartphone via bluetooth no more doubts commercialization planned for beginning 2019 these results patented by unige and awarded the prix de linnovation academy in december 2017 will be marketed from 2019 by abcdx a startup founded four years ago by jeancharles sanchez of unige and joan montaner of vall dhebron hospital in barcelona coauthors of this study today our research shows that the results are even more accurate when we combine hfabp and gfap levels continues jeancharles sanchez we are currently preparing an even more effective tbicheck which will allow 50 of patients to be sent home

fake,san franciscoa new study presented today at the society of neurointerventional surgerys snis 15th annual meeting found that new stroke imaging technology could decrease delays in care by up to 60 minutes giving patients a better chance at making a full recovery the study new multiple ct assessment of acute stroke patients are we ready for prime time shows that recent advances in imaging software in the angiosuite give neurointerventionalists the essential details required to diagnose a patient with large vessel occlusion lvo for an endovascular thrombectomy evt this study suggests that in the future stroke patients can bypass the ct scan or emergency department and go directly to the angiosuite for imaging and proper care by using this technology in the angiosuite hospitals can reduce intrafacility transfer delays and hence the time of stroke symptom onset to treatment which will significantly reduce brain damage and improve outcomes for patients said nicole cancelliere lead author of the study and an interventional clinical research technologist at toronto western hospital the time required to transfer a patient from their ct scan to the operating room could delay evt by as long as 60 minutes preliminary results show that the cone beam imaging software compares favorably with baseline and followup ct scans the imaging allows accurate detection of hemorrhage occlusion site ischemic core and tissue at risk suggesting that baseline imaging can be performed in the angiosuite using cone beam imaging the lead pi on this study professor vitor mendes pereira concluded by saying by reducing intrafacility transfer times patients can receive evt treatment sooner which can significantly impact patient outcomes
fake,ultrasound waves applied to the whole brain improve cognitive dysfunction in mice with conditions simulating vascular dementia and alzheimers disease the research conducted by scientists at tohoku university in japan suggests that this type of therapy may also benefit humans the team led by cardiologist hiroaki shimokawa found that applying lowintensity pulsed ultrasound lipus to the whole brain of the mice improved blood vessel formation and nerve cell regeneration without having obvious side effects the lipus therapy is a noninvasive physiotherapy that could apply to highrisk elderly patients without the need for surgery or anaesthesia and could be used repeatedly says shimokawa dementia affects about 50 million people worldwide with 10 million new cases occurring every year but there are currently no curative treatments available for vascular dementia or alzheimers disease the most common causes of dementia also the cells lining the brains blood vessels are tightly packed forming a bloodbrain barrier that prevents large molecules from crossing into the brain tissue this limits the types of drugs and cell therapies that could be made available to treat dementia shimokawa and his team had conducted previous studies showing that lipus improved blood vessel formation in pigs with myocardial ischemia a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the heart other studies have reported that lipus increases the production of proteins involved in nerve cell survival and growth in addition to a role in promoting nerve regeneration focusing lipus treatment on a region in the brain called the hippocampus which is involved in memory has also been found to improve dementia in mice but the details of how it does this need to be more fully investigated the tohoku university team wanted to find out if wholebrain rather than focused lipus is effective in treating mouse models of dementia and if it was what was happening at the molecular levels to achieve this they found that cognitive impairment markedly improved in mice with conditions similar to vascular dementia and alzheimers disease when lipus was applied to the whole brain three times a day for 20 minutes each time the mice with vascular dementia received the treatment on the first third and fifth days following a surgical procedure that limited the brains blood supply the mice with a condition simulating alzheimers disease in humans received 11 lipus treatments over a period of three months at the molecular level genes related to the cells lining blood vessels were turned on also there was increased expression of an enzyme involved in blood vessel formation and a protein involved in nerve cell survival and growth the researchers conclude that their study recently published in the journal brain stimulation provides the first experimental evidence that wholebrain lipus therapy markedly improves cognitive dysfunctions without serious side effects by enhancing specific cells related to dementias pathology the first clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the lipus treatment are already underway
fake,sugar improves memory in older adults and makes them more motivated to perform difficult tasks at full capacity according to new research by the university of warwick sugar improves memory in older adults and makes them more motivated to perform difficult tasks at full capacity according to new research by the university of warwick led by phd student konstantinos mantantzis professor elizabeth maylor and dr friederike schlaghecken in warwicks department of psychology the study found that increasing blood sugar levels not only improves memory and performance but makes older adults feel happier during a task the researchers gave young aged 1827 and older aged 6582 participants a drink containing a small amount of glucose and got them to perform various memory tasks other participants were given a placebo a drink containing artificial sweetener the researchers measured participants levels of engagement with the task their memory score mood and their own perception of effort they found that increasing energy through a glucose drink can help both young and older adults to try harder compared to those who had the artificial sweetener for young adults thats where it ended though glucose did not improve either their mood or their memory performance however older adults who had a glucose drink showed significantly better memory and more positive mood compared to older adults who consumed the artificial sweetener moreover although objective measures of task engagement showed that older adults in the glucose group put more effort into the task than those who consumed the artificial sweetener their own selfreports showed that they did not feel as if they had tried any harder the authors concluded that shortterm energy availability in the form of raised blood sugar levels could be an important factor in older adults motivation to perform a task at their highest capacity heightened motivation in turn could explain the fact that increased blood sugar levels also increase older adults sense of selfconfidence decrease selfperceptions of effort and improve mood however more research is needed to disentangle these factors in order to fully understand how energy availability affects cognitive engagement and to develop clear dietary guidelines for older adults konstantinos mantantzis a phd student from the university of warwicks department of psychology commented over the years studies have shown that actively engaging with difficult cognitive tasks is a prerequisite for the maintenance of cognitive health in older age therefore the implications of uncovering the mechanisms that determine older adults levels of engagement cannot be understated dr friederike schlaghecken from the university of warwicks department of psychology commented our results bring us a step closer to understanding what motivates older adults to exert effort and finding ways of increasing their willingness to try hard even if a task seems impossible to perform

fake,san diego ca knee pain in active patients over 40 is often difficult to treat but according to researchers presenting their work today at the american orthopaedic society for sports medicines aossm annual meeting in san diego utilizing a special kind of allograft may be a step in the right direction our findings note that patients older than 40 may benefit from using a fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation to treat focal cartilage defects a common cause of knee pain in adults said lead author dennis crawford md phd from the oregon health and science university in portland oregon crawford and his colleagues looked at a total of 80 patients broken into two groups the study group consisted of 38 patients 10 women and 28 men who were at least 40 years of age and a control group with 42 patients 27 men and 15 women who were 39 years of age or younger a statistically significant improvement for both groups was noted for the final followup for ikdc and all five koos subscores greatest changes were seen in the ability of patients to perform sports and with improvement in healthful daily activity previous surgical treatment was performed on 31 of 38 knees in the study group and 37 of the 42 knees in the control group this type of osteochondral allograft transplantation has traditionally been used in younger active patients with cartilage disorders however seeing this type of success allows sports medicine physicians another option in older patients and serves as a predictable biologic joint preservation technique said crawford
fake,oak brook ill cardiac hybrid imaging with ct and nuclear stress testing is an excellent longterm predictor of adverse cardiac events like heart attacks in patients being evaluated for coronary artery disease according to a study published in the journal radiology coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide invasive coronary angiography ica is considered the gold standard for determining the percent of stenosis or narrowing due to plaque in a coronary artery however the degree of stenosis on ica is not always an accurate predictor of heart attack risk because it gives no information on perfusion or the flow of blood into the heart muscle inadequate perfusion also known as ischemia is a potential danger to the patient in lesions with less than 50 percent narrowing one in five lesions still produce an ischemia said study coauthor philipp a kaufmann md professor and chair of nuclear medicine and director of cardiac imaging at university hospital zurich in switzerland cardiac hybrid imaging combines coronary computed tomography angiography ccta and myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission tomography spect to provide information on both stenosis and perfusion the approach has shown promise in studies focusing on shortterm observations but information is lacking on longterm outcomes the research team looked at 428 patients who underwent hybrid imaging during a median followup of 68 years a total of 160 major adverse cardiac events including 45 deaths were observed in the final study population patients with matched findingsstenosis of 50 percent or more on ccta with evidence of ischemia on spect in the area of the heart to which the blocked vessel was supplying bloodhad more than five times the risk of adverse events than those with normal findings patients with unmatched findings or evidence of ischemia but not in the area of the heart being fed by the stenotic artery had three times the risk major adverse cardiac event rates were 218 percent for matched findings and 90 percent for unmatchedconsiderably higher than the 24 percent rate for normal findings the results show that cardiac hybrid imaging is an excellent longterm predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients evaluated for coronary artery disease dr kaufmann said that hybrid imaging findings could help guide treatment decisions such as whether or not a patient should have a revascularization procedure such as bypass or angioplasty in patients with multiple lesions or complex coronary anatomy it is in many cases very difficult to correctly identify the culprit lesion he said in a previous multicenter trial with hybrid imaging we were able to see that about one in five patients should be revascularized in another coronary artery than originally planned the present study now documents the prognostic importance of the comprehensive assessment provided by hybrid imaging the study supports ccta use for an initial noninvasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease no additional imaging would be necessary if the results were normal if a lesion was evident then clinicians could employ a nuclear scan to assess ischemia and take advantage of both modalities by fusing the results together to make a hybrid image the strategy of direct referral to invasive coronary angiography without noninvasive imaging is obsolete dr kaufmann said even after documenting coronary artery disease with coronary ct angiography we need further noninvasive evaluation before deciding upon revascularization versus medication the researchers hope to run a trial to show that hybrid imaging can have a positive impact on patient outcomes they are also looking at what they call triple hybrid imaging which combines the cctaspect hybrid with information on coronary artery shear stress the shear stress information could help identify lesions that do not yet have an impact on ischemia but will in the future
fake,new york and san diego june 28 2018 prnewswire an international team of researchers from memorial sloan kettering cancer center msk epic sciences the institute of cancer research uk and london health sciences centre canada have shown that a blood test can identify patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer mcrpc who may live longer if they switch from targeted androgen receptorsignaling inhibitor arsi therapy such as enzalutamide and abiraterone to taxanebased chemotherapy this independent multicenter blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit the blood test called oncotype dx arv7 nucleus detect is commercially available in the us through epic sciences partnership with genomic health inc nasdaq ghdx the research was published online today in jama oncology this liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patients life said howard scher md who led the study and is the cochair center for mechanism based therapy and head of the biomarker development initiative at msk during the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer physicians will now be able to use arv7 status to determine when a patients cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy enabling the patient to live longer this blinded fouryear study followed 142 mcrpc patients who were treated at msk the royal marsden or the london health sciences centre blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with arsi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclearlocalized androgen receptor splice variant arv7 protein in circulating tumor cells the results were that patients positive for arv7 who were treated with taxanebased chemotherapy had superior overall survival os relative to those treated with arsi therapy median os 143 vs 73 months importantly patients negative for arv7 who were treated with arsi therapy had superior os relative to those treated with taxanes media os 198 vs 128 months additionally the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables we developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer which treatment should be pursued next this question weighs heavily on doctors and patients but now with the oncotype dx arv7 test we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes said ryan dittamore chief of medical innovation at epic sciences and a coauthor on the study in addition the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our arv7 test could make the test as valuable to a patients outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug this is the second blinded multicenter clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclearlocalized arv7 test earlier this month dr andrew armstrong of duke cancer institute presented data validating the test in the prophecy clinical trial at the asco 2018 annual meeting the prophecy study investigated the arv7 test in patients receiving arsi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from arsi therapy in march of this year based upon earlier studies utilizing the test palmetto gba a medicare administrative contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies issued a draft local coverage determination lcd for the oncotype dx

fake,wilmington de a delaware team including erin crowgey phd associate director of bioinformatics with nemours biomedical research has published a study in the peerreviewed journal bmc bioinformatics showing that dna patterns in circulating blood cells can be used to help identify spastic cerebral palsy cp patients crowgey et al the work represents a collaboration among researchers at nemours the university of delaware ud and genome profiling llc genpro for short coauthors of the paper include robert akins phd the project principal investigator who directs the center for pediatric clinical research and development at nemoursalfred i dupont hospital for children ud molecular biologist adam marsh phd who is chief science officer at genpro and karyn robinson ms and stephanie yeager ms of nemours biomedical research early diagnosis supports early intervention cerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the us in fact there is no national surveillance here but the cdc estimates that 1 in 323 american children have the condition cp is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity spastic cp the most common type is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness spasms and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children although most children 8590 with cerebral palsy are born with it diagnosis may be delayed until 2 years of age a diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones infants thought to be at risk for cp are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched new and better ways to identify infants with cp are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children nemours internationally recognized for its cp center at alfred i dupont hospital for children serves a diverse population of more than 3000 children and young adults with cp one of the largest programs in the us clinicians and researchers at nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of cp patients funding from the swank foundation enabled nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at nemours in the study the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 919 years to explore whether patients with spastic cp showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients needing acl repairs spinal fusions or other surgeries did not the researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers or patterns that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic cp and those without it in a second study using samples from children aged 25 years the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had cp the evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection said crowgey if we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age then potentially well be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with cp are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without cp the power of data science analytics and machine learning the study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by dr marsh at ud and commercialized by genpro to measure methylation patterns in dna a cells genetic code using next generation sequencing ngs data ngs is a technique that enables scientists to decode dna faster and more cheaply than traditional dna sequencing methods each persons genome or complete set of dna is like a word thats the length of 3 billion characters but spelled with only the letters a t c or g traditional dna sequencing techniques decode sections of dna 700 characters at a time while ngs takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities enabling scientists to decode millions of dna fragments subtle changes in a patients physical health are paralleled by changes in dna methylation making it a useful tool to understand disease many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shiftsmeaning the way a persons immune system responds to external stress events when we find that epigenetic response or signal in the genetic sequencing it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions said marsh the approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of ngs data looking for these distinct dna methylation patterns the data set is massive its not something a human can do you need infrastructure machine learning data analysis and data science said crowgey promising results more testing needed while the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic cp that remains from early childhood to the teenage years the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups including teenagers toddlers and infants from birth to 2 years learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing cp and consequently new therapeutics to manage the disease were still in the early phases but the results are extremely promising and were excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis said crowgey if successful the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders such as infant leukemia akins was optimistic this is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate the experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months were now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population akins added that nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large cp population its growing strength in data science and analytics and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of delaware many issues will need to be addressed but we predict routine screening for cp in the near <10 years future he said
fake,chordoma is a cancer that occurs in the bones of the spine sacrum and skull base only about 300 americans are diagnosed with this cancer each year the tumors can be complex to treat because they are located along the spinal cord nerves and arteries chordomas are part of a group of tumors called sarcomas while slow growing they can be aggressive lifethreatening tumor blindsided by the news his tailbone pain was caused by a lifethreatening tumor tracy sought information and opinions his doctor referred him to specialists at a major medical center in san francisco he learned surgery is the most common treatment but a surgeon told tracy and wife karin rittenberg he should prepare for possible complications said tracy we were told that i should prepare myself for the loss of functionality below the waist including bowel bladder and sexual functions even with surgery there was a high risk of recurrence thats when we began to research other options such as radiation therapy treatment options the couple then met with a radiation oncologist the doctor explained in cases where surgery is not an option or the outcome of surgery was unacceptable people turn to definitive radiation therapy he provided tracy and karin with a copy of a published research paper on chordoma and the effects of definitive radiation the lead author and researcher was dr peyman kabolizadeh clinical director beaumont proton therapy center in royal oak while the findings were written for health care professionals and very technical tracy was encouraged definitive radiation therapy refers to curative radiation explained dr kabolizadeh radiation is the only treatment the patient receives in his study published in the international journal of radiation oncology biology physics he and his colleagues found in circumstances where surgery may result in significant neurologic or organ dysfunction patients can be treated definitively with radiation therapy alone the results supported the use of highdose definitive radiation therapy via proton beam therapy for selected patients with unresected spine and sacral chordomas the san francisco radiation oncologist not only shared dr kabolizadehs research paper but also his contact information both tracy and karin learned about the differences between photon and proton radiation they did their homework on treatment options but for tracy it became quite frustrating karin persisted in her factfinding when tracy was down emotionally you have to understand because this cancer is so rare there is limited research available tracy said that was the truly scary part about making any decisions second third and more opinions they conferred with dr kabolizadeh at beaumont in michigan by telephone the couple also traveled to a highlyregarded cancer center in new york city it seemed everyone i spoke with had a different opinion said tracy i then determined definitive radiation therapy was the way to go but i had to decide which type and where there was photon therapy available in san francisco but in my research i found out the photon beams dont stop at the tumor and have a greater possibility of affecting surrounding organs too i liked what i heard about the advantages of proton beams precisely targeting the tumor and stopping sparing nearby tissue from harmful radiation deciding on proton therapy several factors went into tracys decision to choose proton therapy at beaumont hospital in royal oak not only were he and karin impressed with the advanced cancer killing capabilities of the pencil beam proton therapy but also with the expertise of dr kabolizadeh i looked at survivability length of life and quality of life right now im living life to the fullest and have a beautiful wife we travel entertain friends and are diehard giants fans explained tracy beaumont has the most advanced equipment and someone who is familiar with treatments for my rare cancer i felt that gave me the best chance of success dr kabolizadeh has the vehicle and knows how to drive it every time we spoke he was honest open and candid his candor was refreshing about 3 months after his cancer diagnosis tracy traveled to royal oak in late january to begin his proton treatments on tuesday april 3 he completed his nine weeks of treatment he not only looks forward to watching his beloved giants at att park but hanging out with his dog neyo and karin looks forward to him shaving the treatment beard he has been growing since his treatments began beaumont proton team second to none i realize im extremely fortunate to have been able to consider traveling to another state for treatment and live there for two and a half months said tracy im also fortunate that karins company has been supportive of her working remotely so she could stay with me and im so grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love and support weve received from our family and friends during our stay in michigan that helped keep our spirits high and when asked about his treatment experience tracy remarked every single person that ive engaged with at beaumont has been a delight they all made what could have been a difficult experience tolerable the facilities are impressive clean and welcoming but the difference is the people best hospital staff ive ever encountered the team in the proton therapy center is second to none about beaumonts proton therapy center beaumonts center is one of just 28 proton therapy centers in the us it is the only operational proton therapy center in michigan how proton therapy works proton therapy is a hightech alternative to xray radiation a scanning beam of proton radiation with online image guidance offers greater precision to destroy cancerous cells sparing adjacent healthy tissue with fewer side effects proton therapy uses positively charged atomic particles traveling up to twothirds the speed of light to fight cancer a cyclotron or particle accelerator creates protons from hydrogen molecules the proton beam is sent to the treatment room through a transport system consisting of magnets called the beam line finally arriving in the gantry a device that rotates around the patient the beam is directed to the patient through a nozzle that targets the tumor while proton therapy is not effective against all cancers it is effective in treating many solid and localized tumors advanced technology our iba proteusone singleroom treatment system includes precision technologies said dr kabolizadeh intensity modulated proton therapy which combines pencil beam scanning and 3d cone beam ct can target a tumor within less than a millimeter pencil beam scanning refers to the delivery of protons in a thin beam like a pencil the beam uses back and forth motions to target the treatment area the shape size and depth it paints a radiation dose on tumors layer by layer compared to xray beams which pass through a patient proton beams deliver targeted radiation to the tumor and then stop resulting in no exit dose radiation oncologists at beaumont are well versed in precise image guidance having developed cone beam ct technology almost 20 years ago dr kabolizadeh explained image guidance allows doctors to visualize tumors during therapy to assess response and make sure the tumor is treated correctly every day comprehensive cancer care proton therapy is an important addition to beaumonts comprehensive arsenal of leadingedge cancer treatments beaumonts radiation oncology department is ranked among the nations best for advanced technology innovative treatment and

fake,philadelphia pa reversing memory deficits and impairments in spatial learning is a major goal in the field of dementia research a lack of knowledge about cellular pathways critical to the development of dementia however has stood in the way of significant clinical advance but now researchers at the lewis katz school of medicine at temple university lksom are breaking through that barrier they show for the first time in an animal model that tau pathology the secondmost important lesion in the brain in patients with alzheimers disease can be reversed by a drug we show that we can intervene after disease is established and pharmacologically rescue mice that have tauinduced memory deficits explained senior investigator domenico pratic md scott richards north star foundation chair for alzheimers research professor in the departments of pharmacology and microbiology and director of the alzheimers center at temple at lksom the study published online in the journal molecular neurobiology raises new hope for human patients affected by dementia the researchers landed on their breakthrough after discovering that inflammatory molecules known as leukotrienes are deregulated in alzheimers disease and related dementias in experiments in animals they found that the leukotriene pathway plays an especially important role in the later stages of disease at the onset of dementia leukotrienes attempt to protect nerve cells but over the long term they cause damage dr pratic said having discovered this we wanted to know whether blocking leukotrienes could reverse the damage whether we could do something to fix memory and learning impairments in mice having already abundant tau pathology to recapitulate the clinical situation of dementia in humans in which patients are already symptomatic by the time they are diagnosed dr pratic and colleagues used specially engineered tau transgenic mice which develop tau pathology characterized by neurofibrillary tangles disrupted synapses the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with one another and declines in memory and learning ability as they age when the animals were 12 months old the equivalent of age 60 in humans they were treated with zileuton a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5lipoxygenase enzyme after 16 weeks of treatment animals were administered maze tests to assess their working memory and their spatial learning memory compared with untreated animals tau mice that had received zileuton performed significantly better on the tests their superior performance suggested a successful reversal of memory deficiency to determine why this happened the researchers first analyzed leukotriene levels they found that treated tau mice experienced a 90percent reduction in leukotrienes compared with untreated mice in addition levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau the form of the protein that is known to directly damage synapses were 50 percent lower in treated animals microscopic examination revealed vast differences in synaptic integrity between the groups of mice whereas untreated animals had severe synaptic deterioration the synapses of treated tau animals were indistinguishable from those of ordinary mice without the disease inflammation was completely gone from tau mice treated with the drug dr pratic said the therapy shut down inflammatory processes in the brain allowing the tau damage to be reversed the study is especially exciting because zileuton is already approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of asthma leukotrienes are in the lungs and the brain but we now know that in addition to their functional role in asthma they also have a functional role in dementia dr pratic explained this is an old drug for a new disease he added the research could soon be translated to the clinic to human patients with alzheimers disease
fake,boston june 11 2018 a new study conducted at the university of california davis found that two cups of mangos a day had beneficial effects on systolic blood pressure among healthy postmenopausal women mango consumption helped relax blood vessels in as little as two hours after intake additionally some of the participants showed favorable changes in the production of breath methane an indication of the potential influence on gut fermentation this is the first study to demonstrate positive vascular effects of mango intake in humans said lead researcher robert hackman with the uc davis department of nutrition he presented the findings today at the american society for nutrition annual meeting nutrition 2018 in boston our results build on previous animal and cell studies that point to the potential benefits of mangos to promote health mangos contain a mix of polyphenols including mangiferin quercetin gallotannins and gallic acid that have been the focus of previous investigations exploring the potential healthprotecting properties of mangos li and colleagues believe the concentration of these bioactive compounds in mangos may be responsible for the favorable response methodology and results in the study 24 healthy postmenopausal women consumed 330 grams 2 cups of mango daily for 14 days the honey mango also referred to as ataulfo was chosen for the study due to the high concentration of polyphenols in this popular variety following the 14 days of mango consumption the study participants resumed their normal daily diet but eliminated mango intake for 13 days measurements were taken during each visit including heart rate and blood pressure blood samples and breath samples which are increasingly used in nutrition studies to evaluate gut health status at the start of the study blood pressure was not significantly different between the study visits yet once mango was consumed systolic blood pressure was significantly lower two hours after mango intake compared to baseline values pulse pressure was also significantly reduced two hours after eating mango systolic blood pressure the upper number in blood pressure readings indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic bottom number in blood pressure readings pulse pressure can be used as an indicator of heart health breath levels of hydrogen and methane were measured which reflect the amount of these gases that were produced due to microbial fermentation in the intestinal tract some study participants produced hydrogen some produced methane and others produced both gases or neither of them six of the 24 participants produced methane and of these six three shown significant reduction after consuming mango which is considered a favorable outcome for gut health the researchers conclude that mangos may be a hearthealthy fruit that may help play a role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease longerterm studies involving other population groups are warranted
fake,philadelphia in a finding that suggests the potential for practice change that would reduce the use of antibiotics in dermatology researchers in the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania have found the diuretic drug spironolactone may be just as effective as antibiotics for the treatment of womens acne the study published this month in the journal of drugs and dermatology found patients who were originally prescribed spironolactone changed to a different drug within one year at almost the same rate as those who were prescribed antibiotics the prescription change is a proxy for ineffectiveness since switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy side effects cost or other factors acne is one of the most common diseases in the world it affects 85 percent of people under the age of 18 but it also regularly impacts adults more than 50 percent of women in the united states are treated for acne between the ages of 20 and 29 while more than 35 percent are treated between the ages of 30 and 39 oral antibiotics are the most common systemic treatment for acne and when combined with the large patient population the result is that dermatologists prescribe the highest level of antibiotics per provider among all medical specialties according to the centers for disease control a fact that contributes to concerns about increased resistance to antibiotics across all fields of medicine its clear that a safe alternative to oral antibiotics could have a huge benefit and our data show spironolactone may be that alternative said the studys lead author john s barbieri md mba dermatology chief resident at penn david j margolis md phd a professor of dermatology was the studys senior author spironolactone marketed under the name aldactone is currently approved to treat high blood pressure heart failure and conditions that cause people to retain fluid it blocks the effects of male hormones like androgen meaning its not an option to treat acne in men however those same antihormonal effects can help prevent acne outbreaks in women as a result some dermatologists use it to treat female acne patients researchers compared data on 6684 women and girls taking spironolactone to 31614 who were prescribed antibiotics within a year 144 percent of spironolactone patients and 134 percent of antibiotic patients had switched to alternative treatments suggesting each treatment was working at almost the same rate despite the fact that tetracyclineclass antibiotics are prescribed five times as frequently these numbers suggest dermatologists should consider spironolactone first instead of antibiotics when it comes to women with acne barbieri said in addition to the benefits for antibiotic stewardship barbieri pointed to several studies showing longterm oral antibiotic use may be associated with antibiotic resistance lupus inflammatory bowel disease and even colon and breast cancer this indicates spironolactone may have a better safety profile than oral antibiotics which is another factor that makes it such an appealing option barbieri said he also noted spironolactone is less expensive which may be relevant to patients with high deductibles or who are uninsured spironolactone is not approved for the treatment of acne by the us food and drug administration despite expert opinion supporting its use and barbieri says the findings of this study should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial that directly compares the two treatment options
fake,a portable device common in optometrists offices may hold the key to faster diagnosis of schizophrenia predicting relapse and symptom severity and assessing treatment effectiveness a rutgers university study finds in the study published in the may 2018 issue of the journal of abnormal psychology researchers used reteval a handheld device developed to record electrical activity from the retina to replicate and extend prior studies showing that people with schizophrenia had abnormal electrical activity in the retina this was the first time a portable device was used for these tests the results show the device accurately indicated reduced electrical activity in the retina in multiple cell layers in the participants who had schizophrenia including in cell types that had not been studied before in this disorder schizophrenia is a devastating disorder probably the most disabling disorder long term although we know quite a bit about it its still not that well understood said steven silverstein professor of psychiatry at rutgers robert wood johnson medical school and director of research at rutgers university behavioral health care ubhc who designed the study our study should help generate further research into developing a test that clinicians like psychologists psychiatrists or nurses can use in their offices to diagnose treat and monitor the condition of people with schizophrenia looking at biomarkers in the eye as a way to understand psychiatric disorders is a new field of study since the retina is part of the nervous system what is happening in the retina is likely reflective of what is occurring in the brain silverstein said for example we know that certain changes in the retina like thinning tissue due to cell loss or weakening electrical activity occur alongside loss of brain tissue and reduced brain activity in patients with neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and parkinsons disease we and other researchers are now investigating whether retinal changes are related to brain structure and function changes in schizophrenia in the justpublished study the researchers evaluated 50 participants 25 with schizophrenia and 25 with no diagnosed psychiatric disorder in the test the participants closed one eye and placed the other against the reteval device which flashed 10 to 20 white or colored lights of various intensity against a white or colored background a tiny skin electrode was placed on the skin under the eye to record the retinas electrical activity the participants were tested in normal light and after sitting in the dark for 10 minutes to assess activity in different types of retinal cells most individual tests were completed within two minutes since many of our participants were experiencing severe psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions we wanted to use a test that was as noninvasive and quick as possible silverstein said while the portable device clearly distinguished people with schizophrenia from those without a psychiatric diagnosis its too soon to call this a diagnostic tool said lead author docia demmin a graduate assistant in ubhcs division of schizophrenia research and a doctoral student in rutgers department of psychology however since every prior study has found that people with schizophrenia exhibit reduced retinal wave forms and slowed retinal responses our research shows that we closing in on an accurate test that is faster less invasive inexpensive and more accessible to patients
fake,titusville nj may 24 2018 prnewswire the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson johnson today announced new realworld data that showed frail patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation nvaf experienced significantly fewer strokes and systemic emboli when treated with xarelto rivaroxaban over a twoyear period compared to those taking warfarin specifically longterm xarelto use reduced the risk of stroke and systemic embolism by 32 percent and ischemic stroke alone by 31 percent compared to warfarin with no significant increase in major bleeding results from the study which also assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban and dabigatran each versus warfarin were recently published in the journal of the american heart association click to tweet new twoyear realworld data show janssen blood thinner significantly reduced stroke in frail nvaf patients jaha rwe afib affecting nearly six million americans nvaf increases a persons risk of stroke by five times and accounts for 15 to 20 percent of all strokesiii frailty is a common clinical syndrome mainly seen in older adults that makes it harder for them to recover from stressful cardiovascular events and vulnerable for poorer health outcomes people with nvaf are four times more likely to be classified as frail than people without nvafiii and research has shown frail people with nvaf are less likely to receive anticoagulation than nonfrail peopleivvvi there is not widespread consensus on the best way to manage frail patients with nvaf in clinical practice which is why some patients are not treated at all and remain at high risk of having a stroke said craig coleman pharmd professor of pharmacy practice university of connecticut these results show longterm rivaroxaban use reduced stroke and systemic embolism in a vulnerable patient group without increasing the risk of major bleeding they also give physicians important insights into a welltolerated effective approach to treat their frail patients with nvaf in the study researchers used us truven marketscan claims data and identified frail patients with nvaf taking xarelto apixaban or dabigatran each treatment group was matched separately with warfarin users in a 11 ratio and followed for up to two years or until an event insurance disenrollment or end of followup occurred the primary efficacy outcome was stroke ischemic or hemorrhagic or systemic embolism major bleeding was the primary safety outcome researchers made the following twoyear observations xarelto was associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism hr068 95 ci049095 and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone hr069 95 ci048099 compared to warfarin was associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism hr068 95 ci049095 and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone hr069 95 ci048099 compared to warfarin xarelto had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin hr107 95 ci081132 had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin hr107 95 ci081132 though both apixaban and dabigatran treatment were associated with numerically fewer strokes neither statistically significantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at two years compared to warfarin hr078 95 ci046135 and hr094 95 ci060145 rates of major bleeding were also evaluated for apixaban versus warfarin hr072 95 ci049106 and dabigatran versus warfarin hr087 95 ci063119 this study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive efficacy and safety profile of xarelto across a broad spectrum of patients with nvaf which now includes the frail population said paul burton md phd facc vice president medical affairs janssen pharmaceuticals inc realworld data like this study are critical to informing and helping physicians best treat their patients cardiovascular diseases about the frailty study a total of 19077 patients were identified using claims data from us marketscan databases from november 2011 to december 2016 these patients were new users of anticoagulant therapy with xarelto apixaban dabigatran or warfarin who had not been previously treated with an anticoagulant they also had at least 12 months of continuous insurance coverage and were considered frail frailty was determined using the johns hopkins claimsbased frailty indicator scoring algorithm which weighs 21 criteria identifiable in claims data including demographics comorbidities and physical and cognitive dysfunction each eligible xarelto apixaban and dabigatran user was propensity score matched to a warfarin user in a 11 ratio which helped minimize the presence of baseline differences between cohorts a total of 10754 patients were included in the retrospective study with 2635 taking xarelto 1392 apixaban 1350 dabigatran and 5377 warfarin this study was supported by bayer ag berlin germany realworld data have the potential to supplement randomized controlled trial data by providing additional information about how a medicine performs in routine medical practice however they have limitations and cannot be used as standalone evidence to validate the efficacy andor safety of a treatment additionally it is possible some of the analyses within this specific study may not have been sufficiently powered based on smaller sample sizes about realworld xarelto research xarelto is the moststudied oral factor xa inhibitor in the world today more than 200000 people have been evaluated in published realworld research since the approval of xarelto across all approved indications in the us postmarketing studies and registries continue to confirm the safety and efficacy of xarelto in routine clinical use across a broad spectrum of patients there have been no headtohead randomized trials directly comparing nonvitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants one recent study revisitus found xarelto is providing an appropriate balance of benefit and risk with respect to ischemic stroke and found a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage in routine clinical practice these are two of the most serious types of events physicians work the hardest with their patients to avoid given their potential for irreversible harm what is xarelto xarelto rivaroxaban is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem for patients currently well managed on warfarin there is limited information on how xarelto and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke xarelto is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis dvt and pulmonary embolism pe and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for dvt or pe after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months xarelto is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery important safety information what is the most important information i should know about xarelto rivaroxaban for people taking xarelto for atrial fibrillation people with atrial fibrillation an irregular heart beat are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart which can travel to the brain causing a stroke or to other parts of the body xarelto lowers your

fake,it may seem strange to fight bacteria with more bacteria but it could lead to a longterm solution for eczema patients eczema is the most common skin disease worldwide people suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms a new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a longterm solution for those dealing with the dry itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema the trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin while it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin there are over 1000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin some that even produce natural antibiotics however we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill staph aureus harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema said donald leung md head of the division of pediatric allergy immunology at national jewish health to fight harmful bacteria researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab it is then applied to eczema patients skin as a lotion twice a day for a week bacterial dna from patients skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present ideally we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients said leung what the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy researchers hope that using the bacteriainfused cream will offer a longterm solution where other treatments fall short powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema but they kill good bacteria on patients skin along with the bad creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients but they come with harsh side effects and patients usually cant tolerate them for long periods of time the worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching and the more you scratch the more it spreads it can be very painful said cassandra rodriguez 33 who has struggled with eczema all her life cassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market and says when she learned about the clinical trial she was on board to give it a try the trial coordinator explained that its like a probiotic for your skin said rodriguez you hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin cassandras son also has eczema and shes hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he wont have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has hes little now but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult said rodriguez if there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day that would be amazing experts say there is more research to be done but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream the next steps involve testing those different combinations ensuring theyre safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients
fake,new york april 25 2018 a new method for early and accurate breast cancer screening has been developed by researchers at bengurion university of the negev and soroka university medical center using commercially available technology the researchers were able to isolate relevant data to more accurately identify breast cancer biomarkers using two different electronic nose gas sensors for breath along with gaschromatography mass spectrometry gcms to quantify substances found in urine in their study published in computers in biology and medicine researchers detected breast cancer with more than 95 percent average accuracy using an inexpensive commercial electronic nose enose that identifies unique breath patterns in women with breast cancer in addition their revamped statistical analyses of urine samples submitted both by healthy patients and those diagnosed with breast cancer yielded 85 percent average accuracy breast cancer survival is strongly tied to the sensitivity of tumor detection accurate methods for detecting smaller earlier tumors remains a priority says prof yehuda zeiri a member of bengurion universitys department of biomedical engineering our new approach utilizing urine and exhaled breath samples analyzed with inexpensive commercially available processes is noninvasive accessible and may be easily implemented in a variety of settings the study reports breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among females and the leading cause of death around the world in 2016 breast cancer accounted for 29 percent of all new cancers identified in the united states and was responsible for 14 percent of all cancerrelated deaths mammography screenings which are proven to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality are not always able to detect small tumors in dense breast tissue in fact typical mammography sensitivity which is 75 to 85 percent accurate decreases to 30 to 50 percent in dense tissue current diagnostic imaging detection for smaller tumors has significant drawbacks dualenergy digital mammography while effective increases radiation exposure and magnetic resonance imaging mri is expensive biopsies and serum biomarker identification processes are invasive equipmentintensive and require significant expertise weve now shown that inexpensive commercial electronic noses are sufficient for classifying cancer patients at early stages says prof zeiri with further study it may also be possible to analyze exhaled breath and urine samples to identify other cancer types as well
fake,pullman wash washington state university researchers have developed a lowcost portable laboratory on a phone that works nearly as well as clinical laboratories to detect common viral and bacterial infections the work could lead to faster and lowercost lab results for fastmoving viral and bacterial epidemics especially in rural or lowerresource regions where laboratory equipment and medical personnel are sometimes not readily available led by lei li assistant professor in the school of mechanical and materials engineering they have published their work in the journal clinica chimica acta collaboration with ping wang associate professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the university of pennsylvanias perelman school of medicine enabled the design and implementation of the key clinical validation study symptoms judgment waiting in rural or underserved areas doctors sometimes must rely on a patients symptoms or use their own judgement in looking at test sample color results to determine whether a patient has an infection as expected this process is often inaccurate if they send results off to a lab in a distant city the doctors sometimes must wait for days by which time the infection may have become widespread most existing mobile health diagnostic devices meanwhile can only analyze one sample at a time smartphone vs lab tests the wsu researchers found that their portable smartphone reader worked nearly as well as standard lab testing in detecting 12 common viral and bacterial infectious diseases such as mumps measles herpes and lyme disease the researchers tested the device which is about the size of a hand with 771 patient samples at hospital of university of pennsylvania and found that it provided false positives only about one percent of the time was 97 to 999 percent accurate the smartphone reader which includes a portable device takes a photo of 96 sample wells at once and uses a computer program to carefully analyze color to determine positive or negative results this smartphone reader has the potential to improve access and speed up healthcare delivery said li if we find out about infections we can treat them more quickly which makes a difference especially in lowresource remote areas lowcost components buying the components themselves the research team was able to build the device for about 50 but the manufacturing cost would probably be lower than that he said they have filed a patent and hope to move forward with clinical trials that could lead to commercialization
fake,a study from chalmers university of technology sweden shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better longterm neurological health a new study from chalmers university of technology sweden shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better longterm neurological health parvalbumin a protein found in great quantities in several different fish species has been shown to help prevent the formation of certain protein structures closely associated with parkinsons disease fish has long been considered a healthy food linked to improved longterm cognitive health but the reasons for this have been unclear omega3 and 6 fatty acids commonly found in fish are often assumed to be responsible and are commonly marketed in this fashion however the scientific research regarding this topic has drawn mixed conclusions now new research from chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin which is very common in many fish species may be contributing to this effect one of the hallmarks of parkinsons disease is amyloid formation of a particular human protein called alphasynuclein alphasynuclein is even sometimes referred to as the parkinsons protein what the chalmers researchers have now discovered is that parvalbumin can form amyloid structures that bind together with the alphasynuclein protein parvalbumin effectively scavenges the alphasynuclein proteins using them for its own purposes thus preventing them from forming their own potentially harmful amyloids later on parvalbumin collects up the parkinsons protein and actually prevents it from aggregating simply by aggregating itself first explains pernilla wittungstafshede professor and head of the chemical biology division at chalmers and lead author on the study with the parvalbumin protein so highly abundant in certain fish species increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off parkinsons disease herring cod carp and redfish including sockeye salmon and red snapper have particularly high levels of parvalbumin but it is common in many other fish species too the levels of parvalbumin can also vary greatly throughout the year fish is normally a lot more nutritious at the end of the summer because of increased metabolic activity levels of parvalbumin are much higher in fish after they have had a lot of sun so it could be worthwhile increasing consumption during autumn says nathalie scheers assistant professor in the department of biology and biological engineering and researcher on the study it was nathalie who first had the inspiration to investigate parvalbumin more closely after a previous study she did looking at biomarkers for fish consumption other neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimers als and huntingtons disease are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain the team is therefore keen to research this topic further to see if the discovery relating to parkinsons disease could have implications for other neurodegenerative disorders as well pernilla wittungstafshede stresses the importance of finding ways to combat these neurological conditions in the future these diseases come with age and people are living longer and longer theres going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future and the scary part is that we currently have no cures so we need to follow up on anything that looks promising a follow up study looking at parvalbumin from another angle is indeed planned for this autumn nathalie scheers together with professor ingrid undeland also of chalmers will investigate parvalbumin from herring and its transport in human tissues it will be very interesting to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth there could be some really exciting results more about fish and better neurological health the link between higher consumption of fish and better longterm health for the brain has been long established there is correlation between certain diets and decreased rates of parkinsons disease as well as other neurodegenerative conditions among those who follow a mediterranean diet with more fish one sees lower rates of parkinsons and alzheimers says tony werner a phd student in the department of biology and biological engineering and lead researcher on the study this has also been observed in japan where seafood forms a central part of the diet the team is careful to note that no definite links can be established at this point however more about amyloids and aggregation proteins are long chains of amino acids that fold into specific structures to carry out their function but sometimes proteins can fold incorrectly and get tangled up with other proteins a process known as aggregation as these misfolded proteins aggregate together they create long fibrous structures known as amyloids amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing but can be responsible for various diseases some of them can interfere with neurons in the brain killing those cells and causing a variety of neurodegenerative conditions more about the study nathalie scheers had looked at parvalbumin before in another context i was on a previous study where we looked at possible compliance markers for fish intake parvalbumin is a cause of fish allergies so we knew that it passed over to the blood and that this form of parvalbumin is specific for fish she joined forces with pernilla wittungstafshede and together they took the idea forward because nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins we already knew that they can meet in the gut the blood or the brain explains pernilla wittungstafshede
fake,there are no laboratory tests to diagnose migraines depression bipolar disorder and many other ailments of the brain doctors typically gauge such illnesses based on selfreported symptoms and behavior now a new study shows that a kind of brain scan called functional connectivity mri fcmri which shows how brain regions interact can reliably detect fundamental differences in how individual brains are wired as such the technique potentially could be used to distinguish healthy people from people with brain diseases or disorders and provide insight into variations in cognitive ability and personality traits the findings are published april 18 in neuron this is a step toward realizing the clinical promise of functional connectivity mri said senior author steven petersen phd the james s mcdonnell professor of cognitive neuroscience in neurology and a professor of neurosurgery of biomedical engineering of psychological and brain sciences and of radiology before we can develop diagnostic tests based on fcmri we need to know what it is actually measuring we show here that its not measuring what youre thinking but how your brain is organized that opens the door to an entire new field of clinical testing petersen postdoctoral researcher and first author caterina gratton phd and colleagues analyzed a set of data collected by the midnight scan club a group of washington university scientists who took turns undergoing myriad scans in an mri machine late at night when the demand for such machines and consequently the usage fees tend to be low the researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcmri scans on each of nine people collected in 10 separate onehour sessions for each person during the scans each person performed tasks related to vision memory reading or motor skills or rested quietly functional mri scans generate a dynamic map of the outer surface of the brain showing changing hot spots of activity over time to create a functional connectivity map gratton divided the brains surface into 333 regions and identified areas that became active and inactive in unison she then constructed brain network maps for each individual showing patterns of correlation between parts of the brain the sheer quantity of data available on each person allowed her to analyze how much an individuals brain networks changed from day to day and with different mental tasks the answer not much brain networks captured by fcmri are really about the individual gratton said whether someones watching a movie or thinking about her breakfast or moving her hands makes only a small difference you can still identify that individual by her brain networks with a glance the consistency of the fcmri scans makes them a promising diagnostic tool although the techniques potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago fcmribased diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors offices progress has been stymied by confusion over whether the scans reflect fundamental stable features of the brain or if they change with every passing thought further the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike all of the scanned brains belonged to young healthy scientists and doctors we need more data before we can know what is normal variation in the population at large gratton said but the individual differences were really easy to pick up even in a population that is really very similar its exciting to think that these individual differences may be related to personality cognitive ability or psychiatric or neurological disease thanks to this work we know we have a reliable tool to study these possibilities
fake,chicago screening patients for diabetes based solely on their age and weight a recommendation from a leading medical expert group could miss more than half of highrisk patients according to a new northwestern medicine study of a nationwide sample these limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities most notably asians failing to screen highrisk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic prediabetes and diabetes affect half of us adults with an estimated cost of 327 billion per year the united states preventive service task force uspstf currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia prediabetes or type 2 diabetes when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese by following this recommendation 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened the study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors which the uspstf suggests but does not formally recommend would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes only 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions the study found the expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or nonwhite race or ethnicity this seems like a nobrainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors said lead author dr matthew obrien assistant professor of medicine at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine by demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes were proposing a better path for the uspstf to strengthen its screening guidelines the study was published today friday april 13 in the journal of general internal medicine obrien will be presenting his findings today at the society for general internal medicine conference in denver colorado this is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of us adults the uspstf has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations most notably for breast cancer but there has been little attention focused on this groups most recent diabetes screening guideline intensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes a large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents lifethreatening complications such as heart attacks strokes and kidney failure the earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions the sooner they can begin to combat them obrien said africanamericans and latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic obrien said in the study 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of africanamericans and only 44 percent of latinos asians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight by following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese approximately 30 percent of asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified that would leave 70 percent of asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test which could occur years later the study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines under a provision in the affordable care act all services recommended by the uspstf must be fully covered by insurers but obrien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria this could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test obrien said the study was conducted collaboratively with the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of us adults it builds on findings from a previous study obrien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the midwest and southwest between 2008 and 2013
fake,scientists at the university of waterloo have developed a new tool to protect women from hiv infection the tool a vaginal implant decreases the number of cells that the hiv virus can target in a womans genital tract unlike conventional methods of hiv prevention such as condoms or antihiv drugs the implant takes advantage of some peoples natural immunity to the virus hiv infects the body by corrupting t cells that are mobilized by the immune system when the virus enters a persons body when the t cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the hiv virus is not transmitted between people when the t cells stay resting its referred to as being immune quiescent we know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage t cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission said emmanuel ho a professor in the school of pharmacy at waterloo what we dont know yet is if this can be a standalone option for preventing hiv transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies we aim to answer these questions with future research hos implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in kenya in kenya ho and research partner keith fowke of the university of manitoba observed that many of these women who had sex with hiv positive clients but did not contract the virus they later found the women possessed t cells that were naturally immune quiescent observing this we asked ourselves if it was possible to pharmacologically induce immune quiescence with medication that was better assured of reaching the point of infection said ho by delivering the medication exactly where its needed we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence the implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place it contains hydroxychloroquine hcq which is disseminated slowly through the porous material of the tube and absorbed by the walls of the vaginal tract the implants were tested in an animal model and the team observed a significant reduction in t cell activation meaning that the vaginal tract was demonstrating an immune quiescent state the article recently appeared in the journal of controlled release

fake,researchers have discovered a new class of drug that has the potential to help cancer patients who no longer respond to existing therapies the drug may not become available to patients for a number of years yet but researchers believe that if clinical trials are successful it could be used to tackle a variety of treatmentresistant cancers patients with breast cancer for example frequently become resistant to existing hormonebased treatments leading to the disease becoming fatal in a bid to come up with new forms of treatment that work in a distinct way from established ones chemists biologists and clinicians at imperial college london collaborated on creating a new drug the properties of which are reported in the journal molecular cancer therapeutics the team of scientists at imperial was funded by cancer research uk the drug was then developed by imperial in collaboration with emory university in the usa early labbased tests of icec0942 were successful in targeting resistant breast cancers and indicated minimal side effects icec0942 was then licenced to carrick therapeutics who developed it into a molecule named ct7001 which they have taken to earlystage clinical trials in less than two years the first patient was given the drug in november 2017 as part of carricks a phase i clinical trial to assess its safety and how well it can be tolerated the trial is still ongoing so results are not available yet professor charles coombes from the department of surgery cancer said treatmentresistant tumours represent a significant threat for patients as once a cancer stops responding to treatments there is increasingly little clinicians can do drugs such as these could help to shift the balance back in favour of the patients potentially providing a new option to patients for who existing treatments no longer work professor tony barrett from the department of chemistry said this work is the result of extensive collaboration between chemists biologists and clinicians which has helped to bring a new treatment from discovery to clinical testing in record time streamlining the process the drug targets an enzyme called cdk7 involved in directing cells through their lifecycle which consists of growth dna replication and cell division cdk7 is also involved in the process of transcription a vital step in gene expression the creation of proteins to carry out cell functions particular cancers such as treatmentresistant breast cancers have a unique dependence on transcription meaning targeting cdk7 may be particularly effective by inhibiting transcription icec0942 shuts down the ability of the cancer to spread as well as breast cancers cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia and smallcell lung cancer are particularly transcriptiondependent so icec0942 may work well for these too especially where they have become resistant to other treatments the discovery of the drug was spurred by an initial meeting between professor anthony barrett from the department of chemistry and oncologist professor charles coombes from the department of surgery cancer professor simak ali also from the department of surgery cancer was working on understanding the action of cdk7 in treatmentresistant breast cancer professors coombes and ali suggested cdk7 as a drug target leading the collaboration to attempt to design a molecule that would inhibit its action from early attempts a large collaborative team was eventually founded for drug discovery from bench to bedside directed by dr matthew fuchter in the department of chemistry possible compounds for cdk7 inhibition were modelled using computational drug design aided by collaboration with emory university ultimately a candidate molecule called icec0942 suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests in addition laboratory studies showed icec0942 worked better in combination with traditional hormone therapies for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells which have not yet become resistant it is this molecule in oral pill form that was taken forward by carrick as ct7001 and is currently in phase i clinical trials if the phase i trial proves successful the compound must pass further stages of trial over the next few years before it becomes available to patients early funding for the study came from the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and a major contribution of wholeproject funding was from cancer research uk licensing of the technology to carrick therapeutics was led by cancer research uks commercial partnerships team and imperial innovations the technology transfer office of imperial with support from emory university dr iain foulkes cancer research uks executive director of research and innovation said its exciting to see how cancer research uks partnerships with both academia and industry are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients drug resistance continues to be a major challenge across many cancer types so its vital that we explore new ways to tackle tumours that have stopped responding to standard therapies we hope that this promising new class of drug will offer more options to patients who have few left available to them and help more people survive their cancer
fake,adding the monoclonal antibody drug trastuzumabalready used to treat certain breast cancersto the chemotherapy regimen of women with a rare form of uterine cancer lengthens the amount of time their tumors are kept from growing according to johns hopkins medicine researchers conducting a small phase ii trial of the regimen testing its safety and value the results of the trial published online ahead of print on march 27 in the journal of clinical oncology show that the drug extended the length of time to tumor progression by four to eight months in the sevenyear trial the researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype known as uterine serous carcinoma uterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium or lining of the womb diagnosed in the united states each year but it accounts for more than a third of the 10000 endometrial cancer deaths annually the aggressive carcinomas often dont cause symptoms until theyve begun to spread throughout the body as a result the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreadingknown as progressionfree survivalis only about eight months the fact that these tumors grow rapidly but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early is a double whammy for women says amanda fader md associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the johns hopkins university school of medicine and first author of the new study fader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for her2neu a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers trastuzumab binds to and blocks her2neu keeping it from driving tumor growth and has been shown to be effective in socalled her2 positive breast cancers from august 2011 through march 2017 fader alessandro santin md professor of gynecology and obstetrics at yale university and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the us randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma being seen at the participating institutions to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimena combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxelor those drugs plus trastuzumab some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinomaknown as advanced diseaseand 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma all tested positive for the her2neu receptor among all patients the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progressionfree survival time of eight months and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progressionfree survival time of 126 months however the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease whose progressionfree survival time went from an average of 93 months to 179 months with the addition of trastuzumab even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers says fader who is also affiliated with the sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center at johns hopkins among patients with recurrent disease progressionfree survival time increased from an average of six months to 92 months the difference fader says may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors or tumors with different levels of her2 expression followup studies of the women who remain alivewho now number 35continue the researchers say to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression but the results of the trial they add were strong enough to warrant submission to the national comprehensive cancer network which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country fader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination or other combinations is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more she notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express her2neu is part of a broader trend at johns hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy or precision medicine based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients

fake,vancouver bc march 26 2018 a vancouverbased research team led by canadas most cited neuroscientist dr patrick mcgeer has successfully carried out studies suggesting that if started early enough a daily regimen of the nonprescription nsaid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ibuprofen can prevent the onset of alzheimers disease this means that by taking an overthecounter medication people can ward off a disease that according to alzheimers disease internationals world alzheimer report 2016 affects an estimated 47 million people worldwide costs health care systems worldwide more than us818 billion 1 per year and is the fifth leading cause of death in those aged 65 or older the alzheimers association estimates that there are more than 5 million cases in the united states alone with a new case being identified every 66 seconds the annual cost to the country in 2017 is estimated have been 259 billion with that figure predicted to potentially rise to 11 trillion by 2050 2 dr mcgeer who is president and ceo of vancouverbased aurin biotech and his wife dr edith mcgeer are among the most cited neuroscientists in the world their laboratory is worldrenowned for their 30 years of work in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases particularly alzheimers disease a paper detailing dr mcgeers most recent discoveries were published friday in the prestigious journal of alzheimers disease journal of alzheimers disease 62 pp 12191222 in 2016 dr mcgeer and his team announced that they had developed a simple saliva test that can diagnose alzheimers disease as well as predict its future onset the test is based on measuring the concentration of the peptide amyloid beta protein 42 abeta42 secreted in saliva in most individuals the rate of abeta 42 production is almost exactly the same regardless of sex or age however if that rate of production is two to three times higher those individuals are destined to develop alzheimers disease that is because abeta42 is a relatively insoluble material and although it is made everywhere in the body deposits of it occur only in the brain causing neuroinflammation which destroys neurons in the brains of people with alzheimers disease contrary to the widely held belief that abeta 42 is made only in the brain dr mcgeers team demonstrated that the peptide is made in all organs of the body and is secreted in saliva from the submandibular gland as a result with as little as one teaspoon of saliva it is possible to predict whether an individual is destined to develop alzheimers disease this gives them an opportunity to begin taking early preventive measures such as consuming nonprescription nonsteroidal drugs nsaids such as ibuprofen what weve learned through our research is that people who are at risk of developing alzheimers exhibit the same elevated abeta 42 levels as people who already have it moreover they exhibit those elevated levels throughout their lifetime so theoretically they could get tested anytime says dr mcgeer knowing that the prevalence of clinical alzheimers disease commences at age 65 we recommend that people get tested ten years before at age 55 when the onset of alzheimers would typically begin if they exhibit elevated abeta 42 levels then that is the time to begin taking daily ibuprofen to ward off the disease unfortunately most clinical trials to date have focused on patients whose cognitive deficits are already mild to severe and when the therapeutic opportunities in this late stage of the disease are minimal consequently every therapeutic trial has failed to arrest the diseases progression our discovery is a game changer we now have a simple test that can indicate if a person is fated to develop alzheimers disease long before it begins to develop individuals can prevent that from happening through a simple solution that requires no prescription or visit to a doctor this is a true breakthrough since it points in a direction where ad can eventually be eliminated

nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder hetlioz is currently approved in the us and europe for the treatment of non24hour sleepwake disorder a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder jet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning the clinical efficacy results reported today are from the jet8 phaseiii clinical study 3107 the jet8 study in the jet8 study 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime the jet8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones which leads to jet lag disorder this clinical design allowed for the study of hetlioz without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions results from the jet8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of hetlioz 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints the prespecified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters tst lps waso and next day

primary endpoint the results of the jet8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of hetlioz in treating jet lag disorder the magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful the demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both kss and vas is meaningful and it underscores the ability of hetlioz to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder vanda previously reported on the jet5 study 3101 that examined the effects of hetlioz in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects usual bedtime the results of that study were published in the lancet in 20091 the observation that hetlioz is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that hetlioz will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag hetlioz will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle jet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel it is reported that more than 30 million us residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations of these 60 approximately 20 million travel to destinations in europe middle east and asia it is also reported that 8 approximately 16 million travel in business or first class2 we are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of hetlioz in the treatment of jet lag disorder as hetlioz was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance this challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from los angeles to london washington dc to moscow paris to tokyo or london to singapore hetlioz improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers said mihael h polymeropoulos md vandas president and ceo vanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of hetlioz in the treatment of jet

fake,people with stage iii colon cancer who regularly eat nuts are at significantly lower risk of cancer recurrence and mortality than those who dont according to a new large study led by researchers at yale cancer center the findings were published today in the journal of clinical oncology the study followed 826 participants in a clinical trial for a median of 65 years after they were treated with surgery and chemotherapy those who regularly consumed at least two oneounce servings of nuts each week demonstrated a 42 improvement in diseasefree survival and a 57 improvement in overall survival further analysis of this cohort revealed that diseasefree survival increased by 46 among the subgroup of nut consumers who ate tree nuts rather than peanuts said charles s fuchs md director of yale cancer center and senior author of the study tree nuts include almonds walnuts hazelnuts cashews and pecans among others in contrast peanuts are actually in the legume family of foods these findings are in keeping with several other observational studies that indicate that a slew of healthy behaviors including increased physical activity keeping a healthy weight and lower intake of sugar and sweetened beverages improve colon cancer outcomes said temidayo fadelu md a postdoctoral fellow at danafarber cancer institute and lead author of the paper the results highlight the importance of emphasizing dietary and lifestyle factors in colon cancer survivorship additionally the researchers emphasized the study highlighted connections between biological mechanisms that worsen disease not just in colon cancer but in certain chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes many previous studies have reported that nuts among other health benefits may help to reduce insulin resistance a condition in which the body has difficulty processing the insulin hormone insulin resistance leads to unhealthy levels of sugar in the blood and is often a predecessor to type 2 diabetes and related illnesses earlier research among patients with colon cancer has revealed worse outcomes among those with lifestyle factors such as obesity lack of exercise and a diet with high levels of carbohydrates that heighten insulin resistance and quickly raise levels of blood sugar these studies support the hypothesis that behaviors that make you less insulinresistant including eating nuts seem to improve outcomes in colon cancer fuchs said however we dont know yet what exactly about nuts is beneficial nuts also might play a positive role by satisfying hunger with less intake of carbohydrates or other foods associated with poor outcomes fuchs noted patients may not be eating nuts due to concerns about the high fat content said fuchs for example a oneounce serving of about 24 almonds holds about 200 calories including 14 grams of fat people ask me if increasing nut consumption will lead to obesity which leads to worse outcomes he said but whats really interesting is that in our studies and across the scientific literature in general regular consumers of nuts tend to be leaner dietary changes can make a difference an earlier analysis of diets in the same patient cohort by fuchs and his colleagues found a significant link between coffee consumption and reduced recurrence and mortality in colon cancer when fuchs advises his patients about lifestyle choices first and foremost i talk about avoiding obesity exercising regularly and staying away from a highcarbohydrate diet he said then we talk about things like coffee and nuts if you like coffee or nuts enjoy them and if you dont there are many other helpful steps you can take overall we are working to apply the same rigorous science to the understanding of diet and lifestyles in the colon cancer patient population that we apply to defining new drugs fuchs said cocorresponding authors on the paper are jeffrey meyerhardt md of danafarber and ying bao md of brigham and womens hospital lead funding for the research was provided by the national cancer institute support also came from private sponsors including pfizer oncology and the international tree nut council nutrition research education foundation the private sponsors did not participate in the design conduct or analysis of the study or in review or approval of the paper nut consumption may aid colon cancer survival
fake,minneapolis people who eat vegetables fruit and whole grains may have lower rates of depression over time according to a preliminary study released today that will be presented at the american academy of neurologys 70th annual meeting in los angeles april 21 to 27 2018 the study found that people whose diets adhered more closely to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash diet were less likely to develop depression than people who did not closely follow the diet in addition to fruit and vegetables the dash diet recommends fatfree or lowfat dairy products and limits foods that are high in saturated fats and sugar studies have shown health benefits such as lowering high blood pressure and bad cholesterol ldl along with lowering body weight depression is common in older adults and more frequent in people with memory problems vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol or people who have had a stroke said study author laurel cherian md of rush university medical center in chicago and a member of the american academy of neurology making a lifestyle change such as changing your diet is often preferred over taking medications so we wanted to see if diet could be an effective way to reduce the risk of depression for the study 964 participants with an average age of 81 were evaluated yearly for an average of sixandahalf years they were monitored for symptoms of depression such as being bothered by things that usually didnt affect them and feeling hopeless about the future they also filled out questionnaires about how often they ate various foods and the researchers looked at how closely the participants diets followed diets such as the dash diet mediterranean diet and the traditional western diet participants were divided into three groups based on how closely they adhered to the diets people in the two groups that followed the dash diet most closely were less likely to develop depression than people in the group that did not follow the diet closely the odds of becoming depressed over time was 11 percent lower among the top group of dash adherers versus the lowest group on the other hand the more closely people followed a western dieta diet that is high in saturated fats and red meats and low in fruits and vegetablesthe more likely they were to develop depression cherian noted that the study does not prove that the dash diet leads to a reduced risk of depression it only shows an association future studies are now needed to confirm these results and to determine the best nutritional components of the dash diet to prevent depression later in life and to best help people keep their brains healthy said cherian
fake,oak brook ill an mri breast imaging technique that requires no contrast agent combined with sophisticated data analysis could reduce the number of unnecessary breast biopsies according to a new study appearing online in the journal radiology breast mri currently is used to screen women at high risk of breast cancer and as a diagnostic adjunct to mammography the examination relies on gadoliniumbased contrast agents that need to be injected intravenously researchers recently studied an alternative approach that eliminates the need for contrast agents in some cases by using diffusionweighted imaging dwi measurements derived from mri the technique known as diffusion kurtosis imaging provides a picture of breast tissue on a microstructural level diffusion kurtosis imaging has been introduced in dwi to provide important information on tissue structures at a microscopic level said study lead author sebastian bickelhaupt md from the german cancer research center in heidelberg germany since malignant lesions disrupt the tissue structures at this level diffusion kurtosis might serve as a relevant marker of changes dr bickelhaupt colead author paul jaeger msc and colleagues evaluated a retrospective analysis of data collected from 222 women at two independent study sites the women had suspicious findings on mammography that were classified under the breast imaging reporting and data system birads as birads 4 and 5 breast lesions a birads 4 lesion is considered a suspicious abnormality while a 5 is considered highly suspicious of malignancy the women underwent dwi followed by biopsy for the analysis a software algorithm was developed for lesion characterization and imaging features were extracted using a kurtosisbased radiomics model radiomics is a rapidly growing field that enables the extraction of a large amount of quantifiable data from images in an independent test set of 127 women the radiomics analysis reduced falsepositive findings by 70 percent while detecting 60 of 61 malignant lesions or 98 percent the model might help to lower the number of birads 4 lesions suspected of being cancer on the basis of screening mammography while retaining a high sensitivity similar to the sensitivity reported for biopsies themselves jaeger said should the results hold in larger trials the model has potential advantages in the clinic beyond its ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies in women with birads 4 lesions the software algorithm makes the assessment readerindependent ensuring that its accuracy is maintained across different imaging facilities the new approach is not intended to replace current contrastenhanced breast mri protocols in general dr bickelhaupt emphasized but to expand the spectrum of options available for answering specific clinical questions this might also improve the efficiency of reporting he said

fake,newswise toronto on february 5 2018 a deceased donor kidney has been preserved and kept healthy outside the body in a device that mimics the bodys physiological functions and successfully transplanted into a human for the first time in north america the technique unique solution and device are part of a phase i clinical trial at toronto general hospital tg university health network uhn assessing the safety of the device with subsequent phases examining its efficacy kidneys are the most frequently transplanted solid organ but a continuing shortage of donor kidneys impacts wait times and quality of life of those waiting for a transplant one way to address this gap by the transplant community worldwide has been to extend the criteria of those donor kidneys used for transplantation but these extended criteria organs those from older donors or from donors who have two or more risk factors do not tolerate current cold storage methods for organ preservation well this can result in greater injury to the kidney or in a sleepy kidney which functions poorly at the beginning requiring dialysis until it recovers days or weeks later this early delayed function also impacts its longerterm survival in ontario about 20 per cent of all transplanted kidneys are expanded criteria donor kidneys this means donors are on average older than 60 years or younger than 60 years and likely have hypertension higher bmi body mass index diabetes or died due to stroke ex vivo organ perfusion is an innovative organ preservation technique that seeks to overcome the limitations of current cold storage method of preservation developed in the laboratory of uhn transplant surgeon dr markus selzner with the help of uhn transplant surgeons drs david grant and anand ghanekar as well as drs lisa robinson and darius bagli from the hospital for sick children sickkids it took four years to perfect the solution for the donor kidney and to modify the heartlung machine for use in the warm perfusion technique this technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees celsius with no oxygen slowing down its metabolism and inhibiting the repair process the kidney cannot survive longer than 30 hours in cold preservation the new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself potentially leading to better outcomes for patients using a heartlung bypass machine with customized tubing adapted to the kidneys smaller blood vessels and a specially blended preservation solution of blood nutrients minerals amino acids oxygen glucose antibiotics and drugs surgeons nurses and perfusionists at tg prepared a deceased donor kidney in a transplant operating room to be placed in a warm preservation solution before transplantation into a patient in late november 2017 the aim was to enhance kidney function minimize injury and avoid a sleepy kidney from an extended criteria kidney about 3040 per cent of deceased donor kidneys do not work immediately requiring longer hospitals stays for the patients and dialysis zhao xiao 53 received the deceased donor kidney which was placed on the device for 35 hours at body temperature i feel great says xiao through an interpreter he was able to get up and walk two day after his transplant xiao says he was happy to volunteer to become the first patient to receive a kidney that was improved by the new technology this can make a difference to other patients so i am glad to be the first one helping them with my experience as soon as the donor kidney was reattached to the patient it turned rubyred and started to pour out urine indicating that it was functioning well it is a champion says an elated dr selzner who has done about 500 kidney transplants in the past 14 years it behaved like a normal kidney despite it being an extended criteria donor kidney he points out blood tests within 48 hours showed that the kidney was removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood normally since the kidney did not struggle after transplant there is a greater likelihood that its longterm outcome will be better he adds this technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient we will know how healthy that organ is before the transplant operation says dr markus selzner coinvestigator of the clinical trial dr selzner a clinicianscientist at the toronto general hospital research institute and associate professor of surgery at the university of toronto previously modified the preservation solution and supervised the research on a successful warm perfusion technique for the deceased donor liver organ working on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career says dr lisa robinson division head of nephrology at sickkids it is exciting to see this work be transformed from an idea to experimental research and now to directly impacting patients even with the shortage of donor organs we have to decline some of our donor organs because of the damage they sustain in the retrieval process says dr david grant surgical director of the multiorgan transplant program uhn he is also coinvestigator of the clinical trial and transplanted the donor kidney which was on the modified heartlung bypass machine into the recipient this new technology can help us answer the critical question whats the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients dr grant who is also professor of surgery at the university of toronto emphasized that highimpact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams including researchers surgical residents nurses canadian blood services perfusionists colleagues at sickkids working together on experimental and clinical trials uhn is one of the few places in the world where you can have a good idea and then find the right people to make something like this happen other collaborators on the research and clinical trial at uhn include drs joseph kim and anand ghanekar coleads of the kidney transplant program at uhn and transplant nephrologist dr istvan mucsi dr grant also praised the strong support and efforts of trillium gift of life which coordinates organ and tissue donation across ontario in helping to ensure that the transplant team could begin their clinical trials with this new technique the technique of warm organ perfusion outside the body was pioneered by the toronto lung transplant program at tg in 2008 by drs shaf keshavjee and marcelo cypel to better treat repair and assess highrisk donor lungs outside the body the lungs are placed in a protective dome in which a system continuously pumps a bloodless solution of oxygen proteins and nutrients into the injured donor lungs mimicking normal physiological conditions this makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves and sets the stage for more sophisticated repair techniques to be applied to donor lungs since 2012 there has been an unprecedented 63 per cent increase in lung transplants at tg as a result of this system at any point in time there are about 1500 patients waiting for a transplant in ontario about 1000 people wait for a kidney transplant across the province usually about four years about five per cent of people on kidney waiting lists die every year research for the ex vivo kidney perfusion project was supported by the canadian national transplant research program cntrp a national research network designed to

fake,omega3s from fish pack a stronger punch than flaxseed and other oils when it comes to cancer prevention according to a firstever university of guelph study prof david ma has discovered that marinebased omega3s are eight times more effective at inhibiting tumour development and growth this study is the first to compare the cancerfighting potency of plant versus marinederived omega3s on breast tumour development said the professor in the department of human health and nutritional sciences there is evidence that both omega3s from plants and marine sources are protective against cancer and we wanted to determine which form is more effective there are three types of omega3 fatty acids alinolenic acid ala eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha ala is plantbased and found in such edible seeds as flaxseed and in oils such as soy canola and hemp oil epa and dha are found in marine life such as fish algae and phytoplankton published in the journal of nutritional biochemistry the study involved feeding the different types of omega3s to mice with a highly aggressive form of human breast cancer called her2 her2 affects 25per cent of women and has a poor prognosis ma exposed the mice to either the plantbased or the marinebased omega3s beginning in utero the mice were exposed to the different omega3s even before tumours developed which allowed us to compare how effective the fatty acids are at prevention said ma its known that epa and dha can inhibit breast tumour growth but no one has looked directly at how effective these omega3s are compared to ala ma found overall exposure to marinebased omega3s reduced the size of the tumours by 60 to 70 per cent and the number of tumours by 30 per cent however higher doses of the plantbased fatty acid were required to deliver the same impact as the marinebased omega3s omega3s prevent and fight cancer by turning on genes associated with the immune system and blocking tumour growth pathways said ma it seems epa and dha are more effective at this in north america we dont get enough omega3s from seafood so there lies an opportunity to improve our diet and help prevent the risk of breast cancer based on the doses given in the study ma said humans should consume two to three servings of fish a week to have the same effect besides certain foods containing epa and dha supplements and functional foods such as omega3 eggs or dha milk can offer similar cancer prevention effects he added the next step is to investigate the effects of omega3s on other forms of breast cancer seeing the significant benefits omega3s can have in combatting a highly aggressive form of breast cancer means omega3s will likely be beneficial for other types of cancer

fake,urbana ill nearly every american who has become a parent in the last decade has heard the slogan breast milk is best and has likely been encouraged to offer breast milk to newborns among other things breast milk contains natural sources of prebiotics small indigestible fiber molecules that promote the growth of good bacteria in the babys gut yet for many families breastfeeding is difficult or impossible fortunately modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of university of illinois researchers in a recent study from the piglet nutrition and cognition lab at u of i scientists worked with piglets to show prebiotics included in infant formula can enhance memory and exploratory behavior when we provide prebiotics in formula our results confirm that we can not only benefit gut health which is known but we can also influence brain development says ryan dilger associate professor in the department of animal sciences division of nutritional sciences and neuroscience program at u of i we can actually change the way piglets learn and remember by influencing bacteria in the colon piglets are widely considered a more informative model for human infants than mice and rats their digestive systems behavioral responses and brain development are remarkably similar to human infants therefore researchers are increasingly turning to piglets to test hypotheses in preclinical trials related to human health especially in the context of gut microbes and brain development there hasnt been a lot of work looking at the gutbrain axis in humans but a lot of rodent work is showing those connections this is taking it to an animal model that is a lot closer to human infants and asking if that connection still exists and if we can tease out possible mechanisms says stephen fleming lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at u of i in early 2016 dilger and his colleagues worked with piglets to show that a combination of innovative formula components including prebiotics may play a role in brain development and behavior in their new study the team concentrated solely on the effects of prebiotics starting on the second day of life piglets were given a cows milkbased infant formula supplemented with polydextrose pdx a synthetic carbohydrate with prebiotic activity and galactooligosaccharide gos a naturally occurring prebiotic when the piglets were 25 days old fleming took them through several learning memory and stress tests after 33 days blood brain and intestinal tissues were collected for analysis the test for learning and memory gave piglets a chance to play with dog toys one theyd seen before and one brandnew toy if they spent more time with the new toy that was an indication that the piglet recognized it as new and preferred it this novel object recognition test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies if youre trying to test for memory this test is closer to what wed do with an infant after all we dont generally train infants on mazes fleming says we know from previous research this test works for pigs but this is the first published example of using it in a nutrition context pigs fed pdx and gos spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didnt receive the prebiotic supplements the preference for novel objects an indication of natural curiosity is a sign of healthy brain development and points towards positive development of learning and memory when prebiotics are working the way they should good bacteria increase in abundance one way to tell is by looking at metabolic endproducts volatile fatty acids vfas excreted by bacteria during digestion of prebiotic fibers volatile fatty acids are a global indicator for whether prebiotics had an effect on the overall population of bacteria for example we might want to see an increase in lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria that produce butyrate dilger explains volatile fatty acid vfa concentrations in the colon blood and brain were changed in pigs receiving pdx and gos compared with control pigs recent evidence suggests that bacterial vfas could be getting into the blood and traveling to the brain where they could potentially affect mood and behavior we found that yes vfas are absorbed in the blood of pigs that were fed pdxgos and yes they do get into the brain fleming explains but when we looked at the relationship between these vfas and the results of our behavior tests there did not appear to be a clear connection another surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic when you hear less serotonin theres an immediate reaction to say well thats bad fleming says not necessarily those pigs didnt show greater anxiety than control pigs during a stress test or poorer performance when given a learning and memory test the researchers hypothesize that the prebiotics may alter levels of tryptophan serotonins amino acid precursor but its too early to say although more work is needed to tackle remaining questions the study adds to the growing body of research suggesting a strong and potentially modifiable link between the gut and the brain a link that makers of infant formula should strongly consider there are so many ways we can alter the composition of the microbiota and they can have very strong benefits promoting good gut health remains a strong focus in the field of nutrition dilger says

fake,cancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants thanks to new research by the university of warwick cancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants thanks to new research by the university of warwick led by professor peter j sadler from warwicks department of chemistry researchers have developed a new line of attack against cancer an organicosmium compound which is triggered using a nontoxic dose of sodium formate a natural product found in many organisms including nettles and ants named jpc11 it targets a metabolic process which cancer cells rely on to survive and multiply it does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division pyruvate into an unnatural lactate leading to the cells destruction uniquely this chemocatalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly this unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller more effective and potentially less toxic doses decreasing the sideeffects of chemotherapy the researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers ovarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs such as the platinum drug cisplatin since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity importantly the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as jpc11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells leaving healthy cells largely untouched another improvement compared to existing platinumbased drugs which can also attack noncancerous cells dr james coverdale a research fellow from warwicks department of chemistry commented this is a significant step in the fight against cancer manipulating and applying wellestablished chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells we have discovered that chemocatalyst jpc11 has a unique mechanism of action and we hope that this will lead to more effective selective and safer treatments in the future professor peter sadler a medicinal chemist at the university of warwick commented platinum compounds are the most widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy but we urgently need to respond to the challenges of circumventing resistance and sideeffects our lab is focussed on the discovery of truly novel anticancer drugs which can kill cells in totally new ways chemocatalysts especially those with immunogenic properties might provide a breakthrough it will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic but we are fortunate to have a talented enthusiastic international team working with colleagues in warwick cancer research centre across the borderlines of chemistry cell and systems biology and cancer medicine who are determined to succeed professor martin wills catalyst specialist at the university of warwick commented although asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation processes are well developed in the materials industry this research provides the first ever example of it being achieved inside cells using a synthetic catalyst handedness molecular asymmetry is critical to the function of biomolecules in the body proteins enzymes and our dna for example are handed only the correct hand works in the same way that a right hand does not fit a lefthand glove in this case the osmium compound jpc11 with sodium formate can selectively produce a molecule of a specific handedness thus manipulating how cancer cells grow dr coverdale explained the handedness of molecules is critical in the body our hands are nearidentical but are mirror images of each other the same can be true of molecules and in some cases having the wrong handed molecule can have profound biological consequences we believe that manipulation of the handedness of molecules in cells could provide a new strategy for fighting diseases

fake,children who eat fish at least once a week sleep better and have iq scores that are 4 points higher on average than those who consume fish less frequently or not at all according to new findings from the university of pennsylvania published this week in scientific reports a nature journal previous studies showed a relationship between omega3s the fatty acids in many types of fish and improved intelligence as well as omega3s and better sleep but theyve never all been connected before this work conducted by jianghong liu jennifer pintomartin and alexandra hanlon of the school of nursing and penn integrates knowledge professor adrian raine reveals sleep as a possible mediating pathway the potential missing link between fish and intelligence this area of research is not welldeveloped its emerging said liu lead author on the paper and an associate professor of nursing and public health here we look at omega3s coming from our food instead of from supplements for the work a cohort of 541 9 to 11yearolds in china 54 percent boys and 46 percent girls completed a questionnaire about how often they consumed fish in the past month with options ranging from never to at least once per week they also took the chinese version of an iq test called the wechsler intelligence scale for childrenrevised which examines verbal and nonverbal skills such as vocabulary and coding their parents then answered questions about sleep quality using the standardized children sleep habits questionnaire which included topics such as sleep duration and frequency of night waking or daytime sleepiness finally the researchers controlled for demographic information including parental education occupation and marital status and number of children in the home analyzing these data points the penn team found that children who reported eating fish weekly scored 48 points higher on the iq exams than those who said they seldom or never consumed fish those whose meals sometimes included fish scored 33 points higher in addition increased fish consumption was associated with fewer disturbances of sleep which the researchers say indicates better overall sleep quality lack of sleep is associated with antisocial behavior poor cognition is associated with antisocial behavior said raine who has appointments in the school of arts and sciences and penns perelman school of medicine we have found that omega3 supplements reduce antisocial behavior so its not too surprising that fish is behind this pintomartin who is executive director of penns center for public health initiatives as well as the viola macinnesindependence professor of nursing and a professor of epidemiology in penn medicine sees strong potential for the implications of this research it adds to the growing body of evidence showing that fish consumption has really positive health benefits and should be something more heavily advertised and promoted she said children should be introduced to it early on that could be as young as 10 months as long as the fish has no bones and has been finely chopped but should start by around age 2 introducing the taste early makes it more palatable pintomartin said it really has to be a concerted effort especially in a culture where fish is not as commonly served or smelled children are sensitive to smell if theyre not used to it they may shy away from it given the young age of this study group liu and colleagues chose not to analyze the details participants reported about the types of fish consumed though they plan to do so for work on an older cohort in the future the researchers also want to add to this current observational study to establish through randomized controlled trials that eating fish can lead to better sleep better school performance and other reallife practical outcomes for the moment the researchers recommend incrementally incorporating additional fish into a diet consumption even once a week moves a family into the high fisheating group as defined in the study doing that could be a lot easier than nudging children about going to bed raine said if the fish improves sleep great if it also improves cognitive performance like weve seen here even better its a double hit
fake,a new study suggests that continuous movement while sitting may increase metabolic rate more than standing at a desk craig horswill clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the university of illinois at chicago says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests strategies for increasing nonexercise active thermogenesis defined as spontaneous activity unrelated to a fitness routine are needed to help overcome the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting sitting has been identified as a risk factor for early mortality independent of the presence of a disease such as cancer or diabetes up to 7 percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone sitting is bad for our health but it is a big part of daily life for many people said horswill an expert in exercise and metabolism in uics college of applied health sciences exercise is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting but just incorporating physical activity into one part of our day may not be enough to overcome the damage caused by prolonged sitting and an otherwise sedentary lifestyle because the workday is a major contributor to sedentary behavior with more than 20 percent of workers in the us reporting more than 8 hours each day tactics that promote workstation activity have emerged in recent years including standing desks as well as dynamic pedal and treadmill workstations horswill and his colleagues compared the metabolic rate produced by three workstations seated at a desk seated at a desk equipped with a device that stimulates leg movement and standing at a desk the device which is commercially available was a movable footrest suspended from the underside of the desk which enabled the feet to swing twist or teeter participants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit on a second visit researchers collected metabolic rate and heart rate data during three progressive stages seated seated with the device and standing each stage was 15 minutes the researchers found that modest movement while seated elevated the metabolic rate more than sitting and more than standing by 17 and 7 percent respectively and had no detrimental effect on cognitive function the findings are published in work a journal affiliated with the canadian association of occupational therapists and endorsed by the international ergonomics association these results suggest that nonexercise active thermogenesis which we call neat can increase movement and calorie burning and may have the potential to impact health said horswill the senior author on the study we expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing horswill says the study needs to be further validated but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from neat but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury disability or discomfort this is more evidence that neat something everyone can do throughout the day may be an important strategy for improving health and even reducing early death said horswill haley scott and danel voorhees are coauthors on the paper active ideas llc which offers the hovr device used in study funded the research can you burn calories while sitting at a desk

fake,newswise east lansing mich a chemical found in marijuana known as tetrahydrocannabinol or thc has been found to potentially slow the process in which mental decline can occur in up to 50 percent of hiv patients says a new michigan state university study its believed that cognitive function decreases in many of those with hiv partly due to chronic inflammation that occurs in the brain said norbert kaminski lead author of the study now published in the journal aids this happens because the immune system is constantly being stimulated to fight off disease kaminski and his coauthor mike rizzo a graduate student in toxicology discovered that the compounds in marijuana were able to act as antiinflammatory agents reducing the number of inflammatory white blood cells called monocytes and decreasing the proteins they release in the body this decrease of cells could slow down or maybe even stop the inflammatory process potentially helping patients maintain their cognitive function longer rizzo said the two researchers took blood samples from 40 hiv patients who reported whether or not they used marijuana then they isolated the white blood cells from each donor and studied inflammatory cell levels and the effect marijuana had on the cells the patients who didnt smoke marijuana had a very high level of inflammatory cells compared to those who did use kaminski said in fact those who used marijuana had levels pretty close to a healthy person not infected with hiv kaminski director of msus institute for integrative toxicology has studied the effects of marijuana on the immune system since 1990 his lab was the first to identify the proteins that can bind marijuana compounds on the surface of immune cells up until then it was unclear how these compounds also known as cannabinoids affected the immune system hiv which stands for human immunodeficiency virus infects and can destroy or change the functions of immune cells that defend the body with antiretroviral therapy a standard form of treatment that includes a cocktail of drugs to ward off the virus these cells have a better chance of staying intact yet even with this therapy certain white blood cells can still be overly stimulated and eventually become inflammatory well continue investigating these cells and how they interact and cause inflammation specifically in the brain rizzo said what we learn from this could also have implications to other brainrelated diseases like alzheimers and parkinsons since the same inflammatory cells have been found to be involved knowing more about this interaction could ultimately lead to new therapeutic agents that could help hiv patients specifically maintain their mental function it might not be people smoking marijuana kaminski said it might be people taking a pill that has some of the key compounds found in the marijuana plant that could help
fake,type 2 diabetes is not for life published on 5 december 2017 almost half of the patients with type 2 diabetes supported by their gps on a weight loss programme were able to reverse their diabetes in a year a study has found the first year results which are published today in the lancet also revealed that almost nine out of 10 people 86 who lost 15kg or more put their type 2 diabetes into remission the study led by professor roy taylor from newcastle university and professor mike lean from glasgow university found that 456 of those who were put on a low calorie diet for three to five months and were able to stop their type 2 diabetes medications importantly longterm support by routine general practice staff was given to help the paticipants maintain their weight loss the trial called direct diabetes remission clinical trial and funded by diabetes uk recruited 298 people between the newcastle and glasgow university and builds on professor taylors earlier pilot work professor taylor lead researcher of the direct trial said these findings are very exciting they could revolutionise the way type 2 diabetes is treated the study builds on the work into the underlying cause of the condition so that we can target management effectively substantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas allowing these organs to return to normal function what were seeing from direct is that losing weight isnt just linked to better management of type 2 diabetes significant weight loss could actually result in lasting remission professor roy taylor these findings are very exciting they could revolutionise the way type 2 diabetes is treated professor roy taylor remission achieved remission was defined as having blood glucose levels hba1c of less than 65 48mmolmol at 12 months with at least two months without any type 2 diabetes medications of the 298 people recruited to take part in direct half received standard diabetes care from their gp whilst the other half received a structured weight management programme within primary care the programme included a low calorie nutrientcomplete diet for three to five months food reintroduction and longterm support to maintain weight loss type 2 diabetes remission was found to be closely related to weight loss over half 57 of those who lost 10 to 15kg achieved remission along with a third 34 of those who lost five to 10kg only 4 of the control group achieved remission the findings have been presented at the international diabetes federation congress in abu dhabi today by the lead researchers professor taylor and professor mike lean professor lean said putting type 2 diabetes into remission as early as possible after diagnosis could have extraordinary benefits both for the individual and the nhs direct is telling us it could be possible for as many as half of patients to achieve this in routine primary care and without drugs weve found that people were really interested in this approach almost a third of those who were asked to take part in the study agreed this is much higher than usual acceptance rates for diabetes clinical trials twoyear trial direct is a twoyear trial which aims to find an effective and accessible way to put type 2 diabetes into remission for the longterm the trial is delivered through gp practices across tyneside and scotland to find out if the benefits of a structured weight management programme can be felt in a reallife primary care setting direct also aims to understand why significant weight loss results in remission to understand which groups might benefit in the future type 2 diabetes is a lifechanging condition that progresses over time which can have devastating consequences finding ways to put it into lasting remission could significantly reduce the cost of delivering diabetes care and treating serious complications such as cardiovascular disease kidney disease or stroke remission could transform the lives of millions of people living with or at risk of type 2 diabetes isobel murray 65 from north ayrshire took part in direct from 2014 to 2016 she was on the low calorie diet programme for 17 weeks and put her type 2 diabetes into remission after the first four months over the two year trial isobel lost more than three and a half stone and no longer needs to take any diabetes medication isobel said it has transformed my life i had type 2 diabetes for two to three years before the study i was on various medications which were constantly increasing and i was becoming more and more ill every day when the opportunity came to go on the direct study i had absolutely no hesitation when the doctors told me that my pancreas was working again it felt fantastic absolutely amazing i dont think of myself as a diabetic anymore i get all my diabetes checks done but i dont feel like a diabetic i am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission diabetes uk has committed more than 28 million to the direct study recently 300000 has been committed so participants who wish to continue can be followed for up to three years and the full costeffectiveness of this programme can be evaluated the funding will provide further understanding around the longer term benefits to see if a treatment of this kind could be offered to people with type 2 diabetes in the future helping millions dr elizabeth robertson director of research at diabetes uk said these first year findings of direct demonstrate the potential to transform the lives of millions of people were very encouraged by these initial results and the building robust evidence that remission could be achievable for some people the trial is ongoing so that we can understand the longterm effects of an approach like this its very important that anyone living with type 2 diabetes considering losing weight in this way seeks support and advice from a healthcare professional whether putting type 2 diabetes into remission can protect against diabetesrelated complications later in life is not yet known which is why it is important that those who achieve remission continue to receive health checks more research is also needed to find out who could benefit

fake,the 161 subjects involved in the study consumed at least three portions of chicken and eggs per week that were naturally enriched with omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa the same nutrients found in oily fish the results from the clinical study saw an increase in omega3pufa levels in blood and a positive shift in what is described as the omega3 indexa test that measures the amount of the omega3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa in red blood cell membranes which reflects the levels in your heart and other tissues a low omega3 index <4 indicates a heightened risk of heart and brain disease the study showed that consuming omega3 enriched chicken and eggs resulted in a halving of the number of subjects with such a highrisk omega3 index the chicken meat and eggs used in the study came from birds offered omegapro a sustainable and algaebased source of omega3 pufa developed by devenish the findings were presented by professor alice stanton of the royal college of surgeons in ireland greater consumption of oily fish has long been linked to a reduced incidence of heart attack stroke diabetes and cancer and improved brain health vision muscle and joint health said professor alice stanton international guidelines recommend eating oily fish at least once per week however many people do not eat fish at all and less than 20 of the worlds population have optimal omega3 pufa levels therefore in this project we studied the recently developed alternatives to oily fish or supplementation namely chicken meat and eggs naturally enriched with sustainable algaebased omega3 pufa omega3 enriched chicken and eggs offer consumers an attractive alternative to eating oily fish or to the lifelong taking of supplements with the potential for substantial health benefits professor stanton said dr heather hayes director of food innovation with devenish said offering birds a natural and sustainable source of omega3 pufa is good for the bird and good for the consumer taste panel studies have shown that the omega3 enriched chicken meat tastes as good if not better than conventional chicken this science has demonstrated the

fake,scientists working to develop a gamechanging new antibiotic have made a significant advance towards creating commercially viable drug treatments by producing two simplified synthetic versions of the substance which are just as potent at killing superbugs like mrsa as its natural form the breakthrough by researchers at the university of lincoln uk marks another important step to realising the potential of teixobactin in aiding the global fight against antibioticresistant pathogens teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years the lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale their findings are published in the royal society of chemistrys journal chemical science until now scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic or positively charged amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a side chain this meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin called enduracididine or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs each amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactins structure and the lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine which holds position ten with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged these amino acids lack the binding part overturning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to socalled target binding to be highly potent against superbugs with this new knowledge synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug importantly the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin dr ishwar singh a specialist in novel drug design and development from the university of lincolns school of pharmacy is leading the research team he explained when teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as mrsa we have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as mrsa this simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity a complex multistep synthesis and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields we needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development we had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin now we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different and are commerciallyavailable they are also 16 times more potent than a clinicallyused antibiotic in killing the superbug mrsa and they were also highly potent against other antibioticresistant infections such as vancomycin resistant enterococci and tuberculosis the work builds on the success of the teams pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months dr singh is working with colleagues from the school of life sciences and the school of chemistry at the university of lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug it has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year the development of new antibiotics which can be used as a last resort when other drugs are ineffective is therefore a crucial area of study for healthcare researchers around the world
fake,a breakthrough study led by the university of sydneys brain and mind centre and royal prince alfred hospital has revealed unique molecules in the blood of people with multiple sclerosis ms that could become definitive diagnostic biomarkers of the worlds most common neurologic disability in young adults published today in scientific reports the discovery identifies tiny dysregulated microrna molecules that correctly diagnose ms and discriminate between patients at different disease stages all in a simple blood test currently there is no definitive test for ms diagnosis and disease monitoring relies on several parameters including clinical examination mri cerebrospinal fluid assessment and electrophysiology ms is a chronic disease so current diagnostic and monitoring tests are costly and still have limited utility to discriminate between different stages of the disease key findings in addition to identifying biomarkers that distinguish healthy people from those with ms the researchers identified nine unique microrna molecules that differentiate between two ms subtypes relapsingremitting ms rrms and progressive ms relapsingremitting ms rrms affects 70 percent of people and often evolves into a secondary progressive form of ms 1015 percent of people with ms are diagnosed with a progressive form of the disease from the outset known as primary progressive ms the team also validated eight out of nine microrna molecules in an independent group of progressive ms cases confirming the reproducibility of the findings this is the first demonstration that micrornas associated with circulating exosomes in blood are informative biomarkers not only for the diagnosis of ms but in predicting disease subtypes with a high degree of accuracy said associate professor michael buckland head of the department of neuropathology at rpa hospital and the brain and mind centre university of sydney the research was made possible through the generosity of patients at the brain mind centres multidisciplinary multiple sclerosis clinic a collaborative service offered by royal prince alfred hospital and the university of sydney the research was funded by an incubator grant from ms research australia this blood test may allow people with ms to begin treatment earlier and identify the most appropriate treatment for their condition said dr matthew miles ceo ms research australia this in turn may lead to fewer relapses and a slower loss of brain volume resulting in slowing or potentially halting progression of the disease for the person living with ms it will also help remove the uncertainty surrounding which sub type of the disease an individual has and therefore be a catalyst for better outcomes for all people with ms about the science multiple sclerosis ms is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system cns the research team assessed the utility of micrornas mirna in serum blood exosomes as biomarkers of ms disease microrna are small noncoding rna that control many genes and processes vital for cellular life such as metabolism development and the immune system they are called mirna because they are very short only 1825 letters long science has so far identified about 1800 human mirnas exosomes are nanosized particles shed by almost all cell types in the body and are packed with micrornas and other types of small rna the research team has shown previously that some micrornas are selectively packaged into exosomes for release from the cell exosomes are tiny packages released by both healthy and diseased cells in the body they circulate in blood and can be purified in their millions from a single vial of blood dubbed the biological equivalent of tweeting the exosomes circulate throughout the body and can deliver their cargo of information to multiple cells in almost realtime in inflammatory diseases such as ms there is a significant increase in circulating exosome concentrations in studying the blood exosomes of healthy volunteers and patients with ms the research team identified a molecular signature of ms that not only correctly diagnoses ms but also discriminates between patients with different stages of disease associate professor buckland said exosomes released by brain cells circulating in the blood so they offer an easily accessible way to monitor diseases of the brain we are only now starting to wake up to their enormous potential as clinical tests given exosomes can cross the bloodbrain barrier it is likely that some of the circulating exosomes in ms patients come from affected central nervous system cells or the associated inflammatory milieu the researchers hypothesised that physiological changes associated with ms and its progression is reflected in differences in serum exosomal micrornas using next generation sequencing and integrative bioinformatics they found that serum exosome microrna profiles not only distinguish ms from healthy controls but also distinguish relapsingremitting ms rrms from progressive ms with high accuracy
fake,genetic test could help fight secondary breast cancer new genetic test could benefit thousands of breast cancer patients at risk of developing aggressive secondary tumours bone strengthening drugs can help prevent the disease from spreading to the bone thousands of breast cancer patients at risk of developing aggressive secondary tumours could benefit from a potential new genetic test a study led by researchers at the university of sheffield has shown women with breast cancer who lack a key genetic marker are more likely to respond to a treatment that can prevent the disease spreading to their bones secondary cancer known as metastasis is the most common cause of death in breast cancer patients as there are few effective treatments once it has taken root it occurs when cancer cells spread to another site in the body around 70 per cent of secondary breast cancer patients have tumours in the bone large scale clinical trials indicate a group of bone strengthening drugs known as bisphosphonates can help prevent the disease from spreading to bone in breast cancer patients if given early enough the difficulty is identifying which patients will benefit from these drugs said professor robert coleman emeritus professor of medical oncology who led the new study it only seems to be effective in some patients particularly older women while others show no response and in some younger women it may even be harmful the new study which is published in the journal lancet oncology has shown it may be possible to identify women who will benefit from bisphosphonates by using a test that looks for a gene known as maf women who do not carry the gene approximately 80 per cent of women with breast cancer were found to benefit from the bone strengthening treatment professor coleman said if the test is negative for this gene then they can be offered this bone strengthening treatment which can give them a better chance of surviving their cancer a test for the gene known as maftest has been developed by a spanish medical company called inbiomotion following work conducted at the institute for research in biomedicine irb in barcelona the new study which is published in the journal lancet oncology was part of an international phase 3 clinical trial involving 3360 women with stage ii or iii breast cancer the results need to be confirmed in a second trial currently underway in the united states before the test is likely to receive approval for wider use in patients but if successful it could be incorporated into the routine testing of breast cancer patients to see if they could benefit from bisphosphonate treatments such as zoledronic acid those found not to carry the gene could be given the drug after having surgery and radiotherapy for their primary tumour in an effort to prevent the cancer from spreading around 50000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the uk each year and the disease claims the lives of 11500 annually the discovery made at irb barcelona and tested in the current study could be of great use to clinicians and would avoid unnecessary treatment of patients who would not benefit or could be harmed by the treatment added

fake,up to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting without otherwise having to count calories helps fight obesity and other metabolic disorders such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks this is according to a study by kyounghan kim and yun hye kim in the journal cell research which is published by springer nature intermittent fasting in mice helped to kickstart the animals metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat the research team was led by hoonki sung of the hospital for sick children in ontario canada research has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestylerelated metabolic diseases such as diabetes heart disease and obesity for this reason dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity the research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body they exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting the recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days followed by one day without anything to eat their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food the lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect the fasting regime helped lower fat buildup in the white fat by increasing the brownlike fat involved in burning energy and producing body heat of mice on the high fat diet their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable in a further experiment similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting through an analysis into the underlying biology involved the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells there are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the bodys reaction to inflammation a type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered known as antiinflammatory macrophages these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat this happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor vegf that help form blood vessels and activate antiinflammatory macrophage intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders says kyounghan kim strikingly these fastingstimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24hour fasting and are completely reversed when mice start eating again adds yun hye kim
fake,benefits of green tea were already known new ucla study shows that polyphenols in both varieties alter gut bacteria ucla researchers have demonstrated for the first time that black tea may promote weight loss and other health benefits by changing bacteria in the gut in a study of mice the scientists showed that black tea alters energy metabolism in the liver by changing gut metabolites the research is published in the european journal of nutrition the study found that both black and green tea changed the ratio of intestinal bacteria in the animals the percentage of bacteria associated with obesity decreased while bacteria associated with lean body mass increased previous studies indicated that chemicals in green tea called polyphenols are absorbed and alter the energy metabolism in the liver the new findings show that black tea polyphenols which are too large to be absorbed in the small intestine stimulate the growth of gut bacterium and the formation of shortchain fatty acids a type of bacterial metabolites that has been shown to alter the energy metabolism in the liver it was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue said susanne henning the studys lead author and an adjunct professor at the ucla center for human nutrition which is part of the david geffen school of medicine at ucla our new findings suggest that black tea through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans the results suggest that both green and black teas are prebiotics substances that induce the growth of good microorganisms that contribute to a persons wellbeing she said in the study four groups of mice received different diets two of which were supplemented with green tea or black tea extracts lowfat highsugar highfat highsugar highfat highsugar and green tea extract highfat highsugar and black tea extract after four weeks the weights of the mice that were given green or black tea extracts dropped to the same levels as those of the mice that received the lowfat diet throughout the study the researchers also collected samples from the mices large intestines to measure bacteria content and liver tissues to measure fat deposits in the mice that consumed either type of tea extract there was less of the type of bacteria associated with obesity and more of the bacteria associated with lean body mass however only the mice that consumed black tea extract had an increase in a type of bacteria called pseudobutyrivibrio which could help explain the difference between how black tea and green tea change energy metabolism dr zhaoping li director of the ucla center for human nutrition chief of the ucla division of clinical nutrition and the studys senior author said the findings suggest that the health benefits of both green tea and black tea go beyond their antioxidant benefits and that both teas have a strong impact on the gut microbiome for black tea lovers there may be a new reason to keep drinking it she said the findings build on a 2015 ucla study that demonstrated that both green tea and black tea helped prevent obesity in mice that consumed a highfat highsugar diet
fake,cooling babies deprived of oxygen at birth perinatal asphyxia can reduce the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood according to a new study published in the journal epilepsia the study has been led by marianne thoresen professor of neonatal neuroscience from the bristol medical school translational health sciences at the university of bristol it is known that newborn babies who suffer perinatal asphyxia may develop permanent brain injury resulting in cerebral palsy or other conditions like epilepsy until recently 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment the patients cognitive performance life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition the research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment known as therapeutic hypothermia for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth for up to eight years the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at st michaels hospital bristol part of university hospitals bristol nhs foundation trust the study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age the research found that babies born after 2007 who received the cooling treatment had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced at two years seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis however far fewer only two per cent were on regular antiepileptic drugs the study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication however these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care before therapeutic hypothermia was introduced poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent 32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability in this cohort born after 2007 the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent 11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability also the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment professor marianne thoresen said even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood cooling treatment also reduces the number and severity of cerebral palsy and increases the number of patients who survive normally

fake,researchers from the university of copenhagen and humanitarian organizations have conducted a large study in burkina faso in west africa treating more than 1600 children with acute malnutrition the study published monday 11 september in the open access medical journal plos medicine showed that cornsoy porridge should be replaced with a lipidbased nutrient supplement lns a fortified peanut butter the results of the study can be used directly both in the treatment and prevention of acute malnutrition globally more than 50 million children are affected by acute malnutrition those with the most severe acute malnutrition have more than ten times increased mortality and those surviving may have impaired development compared to children without malnutrition but this can be prevented if children are treated early while they only have moderate acute malnutrition lns supports healthy growth christian fabiansen md phd and a team from the department of nutrition sports and exercise at the university of copenhagen conducted the study in collaboration with a phdstudent from the institut de recherche en sciences de la sant in rural northern burkina faso where there was a high prevalence of acute malnutrition dr fabiansen previously worked in humanitarian medical projects with mdecins sans frontires msf who also sponsored this work the research was conducted in a malnutrition project run by the medical humanitarian organisation the alliance for international medical action alima and its burkinabe partners keoogo and sos mdecins during the trial 1609 small children with moderate acute malnutrition were given either lns or cornsoy porridge for 12 weeks the study found that children who received lns experienced greater weight gain and the large majority of the weight gain was healthy lean tissue dr fabiansen the main author of the paper appearing in plos medicine today underscores the importance of the findings previous studies of nutritional supplements have mainly looked at the effect on weight gain it has been a concern that lns with its very high fat content would result mainly in weight gain composed of fat but by using a method based measurement of heavy water in the childs body we have found that lns mainly increase lean mass that is muscles and organs which are important for immune function survival and development novel standard for research in malnutrition may save lives professor henrik friis the senior author on the paper points to the importance of the collaboration between university researchers and humanitarian organizations it has been a new way to conduct research that we tested the effect of nutritional supplements used mainly by aid agencies employing very advanced research methods in remote rural areas where humanitarian organization are working and not at the university hospitals the collaboration between researchers and humanitarian organizations means these findings can have immediate practical impact on field practice the general director of the danish section of msf jesper h brix notes acute malnutrition is still a major global health problem so i hope we can use the results to provide the best possible treatment for more vulnerable children if we can treat children with moderate acute malnutrition with the scientifically proven most effective food aid product and thereby prevent severe acute malnutrition then many lives can be saved dr susan shepherd a paediatrician who heads alimas operational and clinical research says alima is very proud of its participation in this study vulnerable children no matter where they live deserve the best medical and nutritional treatments available studies like treatfood generate the evidence we need to make the best decisions with our patients alima is committed to developing more research partnerships in its humanitarian projects because this is how we will raise the quality of medical practice for all treatfood treating acute malnutrition university of copenhagen doctors without borders and alima have collaborated on the project treatfood which aims to improve products for children with acute malnutrition the study was primarily funded by danida msfdenmark and msfnorway and usaid via the world food programme the main treatfood results are presented in the paper effectiveness of food supplements in increasing fatfree

fake,east lansing mich michigan state university scientists now have early proof that an antidepressant drug thats been around for more than 50 years could slow the progression of parkinsons in a proofofconcept study published in the journal neurobiology of disease the drug nortriptyline which has been used to treat depression and nerve pain stopped the growth of abnormal proteins that can build up in the brain and lead to the development of the disease depression is a very frequent condition associated with parkinsons so we became interested in whether an antidepressant could modify how the disease progresses said tim collier lead author of the federally funded study and a neuroscientist at msu collier and collaborator katrina paumier an assistant professor of molecular medicine began looking at previous patient data to see if individuals who were on antidepressants experienced any delay in their need to go on a standard parkinsons therapy called levodopa this type of therapy increases levels of dopamine a natural chemical in the body that sends signals to other nerve cells and can significantly decrease in cases of parkinsons the medication also treats many of the symptoms associated with the disease such as tremors and poor muscle control we found that those on a certain class of antidepressant called tricyclics didnt need the levodopa therapy until much later compared to those who werent on that type of antidepressant medication collier said collier then began testing rats with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline and found that it indeed was able to decrease the amount of abnormal protein that can build up in the brain this protein known as alphasynuclein can cause the brains nerve cells to die when in a clustered state and is a hallmark sign of the disease to further back up his research he enlisted the help of his colleague and coauthor lisa lapidus who in previous studies had already detected whether certain compounds could bind to alphasynuclein and stop it from accumulating proteins are constantly moving and changing shape said lapidus a professor in the department of physics and astronomy by using a test tube model we found that by adding nortriptyline to the alphasynuclein proteins they began to move and change shape much faster preventing the proteins from clumping together the idea that this clustering effect is controlled by how fast or slow a protein reconfigures itself is typically not a standard way of thinking in research on proteins but our work has been able to show these changes understanding how these proteins can clump together could point researchers in new directions and help them find other possible drugs that could potentially treat parkinsons what weve essentially shown is that an already fdaapproved drug thats been studied over 50 years and is relatively well tolerated could be a much simpler approach to treating the disease itself not just the symptoms collier said collier is already looking for funding for the next phase of his research and hopes to lead a human clinical trial using the drug in the future

fake,historic discovery promises to prevent miscarriages and birth defects globally update click here to read the latest statement from the victor chang institute overview one of australias greatest discoveries in pregnancy research vitamin b3 can potentially treat molecular deficiencies which cause miscarriages and birth defects discovery promises to reduce miscarriages and birth defects findings expected to change the way pregnant women are cared for a blockbuster world first breakthrough at sydneys victor chang cardiac research institute is expected to prevent recurrent miscarriages and multiple types of birth defects in one of australias most significant discoveries in pregnancy research crucially australian scientists have also demonstrated a potential cure in the form of a common dietary supplement this historic discovery is expected to forever change the way pregnant women are cared for around the globe every year 49 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in australia in the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery until now this breakthrough led by professor sally dunwoodie from the victor chang institute has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart spinal kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies the ramifications are likely to be huge this has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world and i do not use those words lightly says professor dunwoodie the landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule known as nad can prevent a babys organs from developing correctly in the womb nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad is one of the most important molecules in all living cells nad synthesis is essential for energy production dna repair and cell communication environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production which can cause a nad deficiency world first research at the victor chang institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming now after 12 years of research our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin professor dunwoodie revealed at the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin b3 also known as niacin scientists at the victor chang institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects vitamin b3 is required to make nad and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite however a recent studyi found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin b3 in their first trimester which is the critical time in organ development by the third trimester vitamin b3 levels were low in 60 of pregnant women this indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin b3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements using a preclinical mouse model scientists at the victor chang institute investigated the effect of vitamin b3 on developing embryos the results were astounding before vitamin b3 was introduced into the mothers diet embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects after the dietary change both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented with all the offspring born perfectly healthy this discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies as a result consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70 decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects according to the executive director of the victor chang cardiac research institute professor robert graham the implications are profound just like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida professor dunwoodies research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin b3 very early on even before they become pregnant this could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world said professor graham we believe that this breakthrough will be one of our countrys greatest medical discoveries its extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time its actually a double breakthrough said professor graham the next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure nad levels this will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin b3 the findings have been released today by the new england journal of medicine the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world this study would not have been possible without the generous support of the chain reaction foundation the key foundation and the national health and medical research council statistics 1 in 4 pregnant women will suffer a miscarriage 49 million babies are born with a serious birth defect worldwide every year 33 million children under five die from serious birth defects annually congenital heart disease is the most common form of birth defect affecting 1 in 100 babies 42 babies are born with a heart

fake,there is a group of metastatic breast cancers that has the her2 gene amplified the cells have many copies of it which leads to enhanced activity of the product enzyme a tyrosine kinase her2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer and breast cancers in which the her2 gene is not amplified do not in general respond to her2directed therapeutic approaches a few years ago when the research teams of dr matthew ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors they found a new mutation in her2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated in this particular activation mechanism the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the her2 gene that activates the enzyme said ellis professor and director of the lester and sue smith breast center part of the national cancer institutedesignated dan l duncan comprehensive cancer center at baylor college of medicine the mutation locks the enzyme into an on position ellis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new her2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation furthermore these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug neratinib with this information in hand the researchers took the next step we launched a phase ii clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a her2 mutation ellis said finding patients that are positive for a her2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a her2 mutation the results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression neratinib was well tolerated by most patients this is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for her2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate the number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands the researchers estimate that as many as 200000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the united states based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases the researchers calculated that approximately 4000 to 6000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a her2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment circulating tumor dna analysis a promising diagnostic tool to identify the patients in this study who carried the new her2 mutation the researchers required tissue from the tumor a biopsy from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the her2 mutation this task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis to assist in our ability to identify patients with her2 mutationpositive tumors we conducted circulating tumor dna analysis ellis said the tumors dna is released into the human bloodstream and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients importantly the circulating tumor dna results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results and they were much easier to determine notably the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial in addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a her2 mutation the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor dna as a diseasemonitoring marker a circulating tumor dnabased blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy ellis said ellis also is a mcnair scholar at baylor read all the details of this study the full list of contributors and their financial support in clinical cancer research

fake,playing football can improve bone development in adolescent boys new research shows in a study comparing adolescent footballers to swimmers cyclists and a control group of boys not involved in regular sport scientists at the university of exeter found football led to significantly better bones after one year of training adolescence is the key period for bone development and poor development at this stage is linked to reduced peak bone mass the amount of bone mass at the end of the skeletal maturation around age 30 increased fracture risk and osteoporosis later in life though swimming and cycling have proven health benefits the scientists said their study raises a question about whether they are good for bone development due to the nonweight bearing training and they say young swimmers and cyclists could benefit from more weightbearing exercise in training regimes our research shows that playing football can improve bone development in comparison to swimming and cycling said first author dimitris vlachopoulos of sport and health sciences at the university of exeter though we focussed on aspiring professionals who played as much as nine hours a week playing football for three hours a week might be enough for a substantial effect we already knew exercise was key for bone growth but here we clarify what type of exercise although we didnt study other sports its reasonable to suppose that weightbearing highimpact highintensity exercise like tennis badminton basketball and handball will have similar effects to football the yearlong study of 116 boys aged 1214 took a variety of measures including bone mineral content bmc bmc measurements were taken at the lumbar spine lower back and femoral neck upper leg both key sites for both fractures and osteoporosis the results showed footballers had higher bmc than swimmers and cyclists after one year of sportspecific training for example footballers bmc was 7 higher than that of cyclists at the lumbar spine and 5 higher at the femoral neck the research was funded by the eu via a mariesklodowskacurie fellowship awarded to principal investigator dr luis graciamarco also of the university of exeter dr graciamarco said the sports we studied are the three most popular in the uk and its important to know what effects they have in relation to bone health adolescence is the key time for bone growth once a person reaches puberty the next five years are vitally important in this respect the athletes in the study were all playing highlevel sport the footballers in exeter city fcs youth setup and the swimmers and cyclists at leading clubs in the south west the boys in the control group though generally active were not involved in regular sport despite the many health benefits of cycling and swimming the study found little difference in bone development between cyclists swimmers and the control group this raises a question about whether swimming and cycling are good for bone development dr gracia marco said we now need to consider how to counteract the lack of bone growth stimulus caused by cycling and swimming possibly by encouraging swimmers and cyclists to add weightbearing exercise in their training one innovative aspect of the study was the measurement of bone texture of the lumbar spine using trabecular bone score tbs the first use of this technique in adolescent athletes the paper entitled longitudinal adaptations of bone mass geometry and metabolism in adolescent male athletes the probone study is published in the journal of bone and mineral research the research is part of a larger university of exeter study called probone
fake,bloomington ind the use of medication to treat attention deficient hyperactivity disorder is linked to significantly lower risk for substance use problems in adolescents and adults with adhd according to a study led by researchers at indiana university the risk of substance use problems during periods of medication use was 35 percent lower in men and 31 percent lower in women in the study the results based upon nearly 3 million people with adhd in the united states are reported in the american journal of psychiatry this study contributes to growing evidence that adhd medication is linked to lower risk for many types of harmful behavior including substance abuse said patrick d quinn a postdoctoral researcher in the iu bloomington college of arts and sciences department of psychological and brain sciences who led the study the results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment as one of the largest analyses on the risks and benefits of adhd medication the study drew on anonymous health care data from 146 million people with employerbased health insurance in the united states from 2005 to 2014 specifically the researchers mined the data to identify people with adhd whose records showed periods of adhd medication use and periods without adhd medication use as well as one or more visits to the emergency room due to drug or alcohol use they then calculated the odds of the visits occurring during the persons use of adhd medication versus the same persons nonuse of adhd medication many factors can influence who receives adhd treatment including socioeconomic factors health care access the strength of support networks and disorder severity quinn said although no single study of realworld treatment practices can definitively show whether medication use lowers risk studying the same people at different points in their medical history helps us control for these factors and isolate the role of medication in their behavior of the nearly 3 million people with adhd in the studys database about 57 percent experienced periods in which they were and were not prescribed medication to treat the disorder about 2 percent experienced an emergency room visit due to substance abuse the median age of the studys participants was 21 for men and 28 for women the majority of the adhd medicines used in the study were stimulants such as adderall an amphetamine and ritalin or methylphenidate a significantly smaller number used nonstimulant adhd medication such as strattera or atomoxetine while concerns about prescribing medications to treat adhd that have the potential for abuse are understandable this study provides further evidence that the use of these medications is not associated with increased risk of substance use problems in adolescence or adulthood quinn said rather this and other recent studies find that the risk of such problems is lower during and after periods of use of these medications quinn is a member of the lab of brian m donofrio a professor in the department of psychological and brain sciences another study from this group recently reported in jama psychiatry found that the use of adhd medication was associated with lower risk of motor vehicle accidents in men and women donofrio is also a coauthor of several studies based on patient data from sweden that found similarly lower risk for substance abuse and transport accidents in people with adhd who used medication the larger number of people in the two more recent studies as well as the use of us patients in the new analyses strengthens this earlier evidence together these studies provide accumulating evidence about the possible short and longterm benefits of adhd medications donofrio said they also provide important information to medical providers who prescribe adhd medication as well as to adults with the disorder and parents trying to make medical decisions for children overall i think people should find these results reassuring

fake,dieters who go vegetarian not only lose weight more effectively than those on conventional lowcalorie diets but also improve their metabolism by reducing muscle fat a new study published in the journal of the american college of nutrition has found losing muscle fat improves glucose and lipid metabolism so this finding is particularly important for people with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes says lead author dr hana kahleov director of clinical research at the physicians committee for responsible medicine in washington dc seventyfour subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to follow either a vegetarian diet or a conventional antidiabetic diet the vegetarian diet consisted of vegetables grains legumes fruits and nuts with animal products limited to a maximum of one portion of lowfat yoghurt per day the conventional diabetic diet followed the official recommendations of the european association for the study of diabetes easd both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual the vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight resulting in an average loss of 62kg compared to 32kg for the conventional diet using magnetic resonance imaging dr kahleov and colleagues then studied adipose fatstorage tissue in the subjects thighs to see how the two different diets had affected subcutaneous subfascial and intramuscular fat that is fat under the skin on the surface of muscles and inside muscles they found that both diets caused a similar reduction in subcutaneous fat however subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet this is important as increased subfascial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes has been associated with insulin resistance so reducing it could have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism in addition reducing intramuscular fat could help improve muscular strength and mobility particularly in older people with diabetes dr kahleov said vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss however we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat thus improving metabolism this finding is important for people who are trying to lose weight including those suffering from metabolic syndrome andor type 2 diabetes but it is also relevant to anyone who takes their weight management seriously and wants to stay lean and healthy

fake,newswise patients with castration resistant prostate cancer crpc usually have a poor prognosis in part this is due to the cancers ability to resist antiandrogen therapy a university of colorado cancer center study published today may 3 in oncotarget shows that combining a cpt1a inhibitors with antiandrogen therapy increases the cancers sensitivity to the antiandrogen drug enzalutamide this is a huge development for men with crpc that previously did not have many options says isabel schlaepfer phd cu cancer center member assistant professor in the division of medical oncology and senior author of the study there is a critical need for improved therapies for this specific cancer type most cells use the energy of glucose sugar some prostate cancers evolve to use energy from lipids fat previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape antiandrogen therapy however there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancers ability to harness this energy source in this study the researchers focused on the cpt1a enzyme cpt1a helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cells mitochondria for oxidation this oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival resistance to radiation oxidative stress and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways we had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy explains schlaepfer in fact we are already able to block the action of the cpt1a enzyme the drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned fda approval in 2006 to treat angina when schlaepfer and colleagues experimented with fat burning inhibitors and antiandrogens in cancer cell lines they found that the addition of ranolazine to antiandrogen therapy made tumors more sensitivity to the antiandrogen drug enzalutamide this finding may have a huge impact on patients with crpc that had very few options before says schlaepfer since the drugs are clinically safe a clinical trial can be designed in patients for whom enzalutamide is prescribed breakthrough study stops fateating prostate cancer cells
fake,robert bush has multiple sclerosis ms which sapped his ability to walk five years ago joseph mcglynn suffered a stroke that seriously impaired his left side also five years ago using technology designed by case western reserve university and the advanced platform technology and functional electrical stimulation centers at the louis stokes cleveland veterans affairs medical center the two men got their feet back under them two studies published in the american journal of physical medicine and rehabilitation show that functional electrical stimulation fes significantly helped mcglynn and bush to effectively walk at the medical center i went in there and i could barely take two steps said bush 42 who researchers believe is the worlds first ms patient to testdrive an implanted fes system the proofoffeasibility test lasted 90 days at the end said bush of columbus ohio i was walking down the hallway to me it was monumental a video of him walking with and without the system can be found at youtu be 17jyakkdrys mcglynn 69 of north royalton ohio could walk with a cane but not easily with the technology switched on he covered far more ground and his pace was twice as fast during his 30week study its helped with balance and confidence said mcglynn who used to tread a lot of stairs maintaining equipment at a steel plant im confident now that i can walk without stumbling and falling a video of him walking with and without aid of the system can be found here youtu be 3cyqfsfqlm nathan makowski an investigator at the cleveland fes center created by case western reserve and the cleveland va said that fes technology has been used primarily for therapy in stroke patients in the past this though is a more longterm assistive system he said addressing needs the researchers hope these studies will lay the foundation for implanted systems that restore some independence to people with ms or who have suffered a stroke their numbers are substantial the national multiple sclerosis society estimates that more than 23 million people have the disease worldwide surveys have found that 93 percent suffer gait impairment within 10 years of diagnosis and 13 percent report they are unable to walk twice a week other research has found that 6 million to 7 million people live with stroke nationally and nearly 30 percent require assistance to walk in both cases there is a disconnect between the brain and muscles said stephen selkirk md a neurologist at the vas spinal cord injury division and assistant professor of neurology at case western reserve school of medicine this system replaces the lost connection the system includes implanted electrodes that tie into nerves that control muscles collectively called hip and knee flexors and ankle dorsoflexors in healthy people the muscles work in seamless coordination each step they take when bush or mcglynn walks he pushes a button on an external controller which sends signals to a pulse generator which then sends electrical pulses to the electrodes the pulses stimulate the nerves which in turn stimulate the muscles in both of bushs legs and mcglynns left leg both guys were taking steps the first time we turned the systems on said ron triolo a professor of orthopaedics and biomedical engineering at case western reserve and executive director of the advanced platform technology apt center when robert bush took a step it wasnt pretty but we saw the potential in each patient the pulses are sent in a pattern that is close to how normal muscles work said rudi kobetic a principal investigator at the stokes cleveland va and apt center we try to time the pattern to stimulation so that its integrated with their ability similar to regular physical therapy we can see results significant improvement both men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and finetuning by the researchers bush went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the trial in that time he used a walker to help maintain his balance when they turned it on the first time i was surprised how well it worked said bush who had to give up his construction career due to the disease i lifted my knee like i was highstepping once we got it finetuned and i got walking i thought it was amazing i still think its amazing mcglynns gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic the researchers said his gait without the system was about 19 yards per minute with the system 47 yards per minute training with the system improved mcglynns speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute indicating therapeutic benefit distance is a challenge he said initially he could walk 83 yards but improved to 1550 yardsnearly a mileat the faster gait i work up a good sweat and that makes me feel good he said due to his improvements the research team is developing a system that mcglynn can use at home and outside ill be able to walk for exercise and hopefully be able to walk into church and into a restaurant mcglynn said when bushs trial ended surgeons removed his implanted electrodes the researchers are seeking funding to fit him with a permanent fes system in a clinical trial in the meantime bush is now back to using a wheelchair but working to maintain his strength and flexibility repeatedly standing and sitting while holding onto a rail or standing for long periods of time im keeping things ready for when they get the green light he said
fake,better known as an anesthetic or as an illicit hallucinogenic drug ketamine has also long been noted for alleviating depression but ketamine has not been tested in a large clinical trial and all evidence of its antidepressant effects has come from anecdotes and small studies of fewer than 100 patients now in the largest study of its kind researchers at skaggs school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences at university of california san diego mined the fda adverse effect reporting system faers database for depression symptoms in patients taking ketamine for pain they found that depression was reported half as often among the more than 41000 patients who took ketamine as compared to patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain the study published may 3 in scientific reports also uncovered antidepressant effects for three other drugs typically used for other purposes botox the pain reliever diclofenac and the antibiotic minocycline current fdaapproved treatments for depression fail for millions of people because they dont work or dont work fast enough said senior author ruben abagyan phd professor of pharmacy this study extends smallscale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials abagyan led the study with pharmacy students isaac cohen and tigran makunts and rabia atayee pharmd associate professor of clinical pharmacy all at skaggs school of pharmacy the faers database contains more than 8 million patient records the research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine narrowing their study population down to approximately 41000 they applied a mathematical algorithm to look for statistically significant differences in reported depression symptoms for each patient while most researchers and regulators monitor the faers database for increased incidences of symptoms in order to spot potentially harmful drug side effects we were looking for the opposite lack of a symptom cohen said the team found that the incidence of depression symptoms in patients who took ketamine in addition to other pain therapeutics dropped by 50 percent with an error margin less than 2 percent compared to the patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain patients who took ketamine also less frequently reported pain and opioidassociated side effects such as constipation as compared to patients who received other pain medications according to abagyan it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain thats why they compared ketamine patients with patients taking other pain medications that control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain abagyan says its still possible though unlikely the effect could be due to a still unidentified confounding factor three other drugs with previously underappreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis botox used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders diclofenac a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid and minocycline an antibiotic after the diclofenac finding abagyan and team went back and looked at ketamine patients who did not also take nsaids and compared them to patients who took any other combination of drugs for pain except nsaids depression rates in patients taking ketamine remained low the researchers hypothesize that the antidepressant effects of diclofenac and minocycline may be due at least in part to their abilities to reduce inflammation for botox the potential mechanism for reducing depression is less clear the team is now working to separate botoxs beauty effects which could indirectly make a person feel better emotionally and its antidepressant effects to do this they are first using faers data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates according to the world health organization more than 300 million people experience depression worldwide if not effectively treated depression can become a chronic disease that increases a persons risk of mortality from suicide heart disease or other factors depression is currently treated with five classes of antidepressants most commonly serotonin reuptake inhibitors for financial and ethical reasons ketamine has never been tested for its safety and effectiveness in treating depression in a largescale clinical trial but it reportedly works much more rapidly than standard antidepressants ketamine is relatively inexpensive and is covered by most health insurance plans if three other antidepressants fail the approach we used here could be applied to any number of other conditions and may reveal new and important uses for thousands of already approved drugs without large investments in additional clinical trials makunts said

fake,philadelphia pa april 18 2017 in the past all forms of metastatic prostate cancer have been considered incurable in recent years the fda has approved six drugs for men with metastatic disease all of which can increase survival in a study published in urology researchers demonstrate for the first time that an aggressive combination of systemic therapy drug treatment with local therapy surgery and radiation directed at both the primary tumor and metastasis can eliminate all detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer while the study is only a first step onefifth of the patients treated had no detectable disease with an undetectable prostatespecificandrogen psa and normal blood testosterone after 20 months the results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach ie has the highest undetectable disease rate such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone according to lead investigator howard i scher md chief of the genitourinary oncology service at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york city the sequential use of the three different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of each in achieving the undetectable psa with normal testosterone level end point which represents a noevidence of disease status longer followup is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured twenty men with metastatic prostate cancer five with extrapelvic lymph nodal disease and 15 with bone with or without nodal disease were treated with androgen deprivation therapy adt radical surgery that included a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection as needed and radiation therapy to visible metastatic lesions in bone adt was stopped after a minimum of six months if an undetectable psa was achieved after combined modality therapy other patients were treated continuously the combined treatment regimen including surgery was well tolerated matthew j oshaughnessy md phd urology service department of surgery memorial sloan kettering cancer center commented while the role of local therapy in metastatic prostate cancer is still under investigation aggressive resection of visible disease performed by experienced surgeons was critical to the outcome of the five patients with extrapelvic lymph node involvement four achieved an undetectable psa after adt and surgery while the fifth needed radiation to reach this milestone however none achieved the primary end point of undetectable psa with testosterone recovery at 20 months after initiation of therapy with adt alone although one patient had a psa of <05 ngml with a testosterone level of 47 ngdl at 39 months of the 15 patients with bone metastases 14 93 reached an undetectable psa when adt surgery and radiation were used ultimately four 27 achieved the proposed end point a psa of <05 ngml and serum testosterone of >150 ngdl at 20 months after the start of adt which remained undetectable in two patients for 27 and 46 months respectively commenting on the study oliver sartor md cancer research department of medicine and urology tulane university school of medicine new orleans la stated the end point deserves special mention as the end point of undetectable psa after testosterone recovery has been previously discussed but rarely studied the authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm many in the field agree but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability regardless the movement toward a curative paradigm is much needed and the investigators are to be congratulated for setting forth a paradigm that can be used to assess the possibility of cure in a reasonable period of time a multimodal treatment strategy for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality enables the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize largescale testing in early stages of advanced disease the end point also shifts the paradigm from palliation to cure remarked dr scher it is expected that an upcoming phase 2 trial will further test this endpoint and combined modality approach
fake,learning skills for positive emotions result in less hiv in blood and less antidepressant use positive emotions are possible even with stress of chronic health problems men using positive emotion skills learned to cope with their stress while control group went on antidepressants findings extend to dementia caregivers women with metastatic breast cancer chicago when individuals recently diagnosed with hiv were coached to practice skills to help them experience positive emotions the result was less hiv in their blood and lower antidepressant use reports a new northwestern medicine study even in the midst of this stressful experience of testing positive for hiv coaching people to feel happy calm and satisfied what we call positive affect appears to influence important health outcomes said lead author judith moskowitz professor of medical social sciences and director of research at the osher center for integrative medicine at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine this is believed to be the first test of a positive emotion intervention in people newly diagnosed with hiv based on the study results the intervention is promising for people in the initial stages of adjustment to any serious chronic illness the paper was published recently in the journal of consulting and clinical psychology the hiv study is part of a larger body of positive affect research being conducted by moskowitz she also is studying the health effects of teaching the skills to individuals with type 2 diabetes women with metastatic breast cancer and caregivers of dementia patients for the hiv study which was based in san francisco 80 participants primarily men were taught a set of eight skills over five weekly sessions to help them experience more positive emotions another 79 participants were in the control group moskowitz and colleagues designed the tools based on evidence showing these particular skills increase positive emotions some of the skills included 1 recognizing a positive event each day 2 savoring that positive event and logging it in a journal or telling someone about it 3 starting a daily gratitude journal 4 listing a personal strength each day and noting how you used this strength recently 5 setting an attainable goal each day and noting your progress 6 reporting a relatively minor stressor each day then listing ways in which the event can be positively reappraised this can lead to increased positive affect in the face of stress 7 understanding small acts of kindness can have a big impact on positive emotion and practicing a small act of kindness each day 8 practicing mindfulness with a daily 10minute breathing exercise concentrating on the breath fifteen months after the interventions 91 percent of the intervention group had a suppressed viral load compared to 76 percent of the control group in addition to the potential benefit of a lower viral load on the infected person there may be public health benefits from a public health perspective that is potentially huge for prevention of hiv moskowitz said hiv is less likely to be transmitted with a low viral load to have a difference like that is amazing the reduced viral load could be because of a stronger immune system moskowitz said observational studies in people living with hiv have shown positive emotion is related to a higher cd4 count an indicator of less hivrelated damage to the immune system or the reduced viral load may be the result of participants better adherence to their antiretroviral drug therapy which generally leads to a suppressed or undetectable viral load moskowitz said the positive emotion intervention also improved mental health at baseline about 17 percent of the control group and intervention group reported being on antidepressants fifteen month later the intervention group was still at 17 percent but the control groups antidepressant use rose to 35 percent the group that learned coping skills did not increase antidepressant use whereas overall the control group increased its antidepressant use moskowitz said in addition the intervention group was significantly less likely to have repeating intrusive thoughts about hiv

fake,more than 35 million americans are trying to quit smoking smoking cigarettes causes 480000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a twofold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20fold risk of lung cancer in a commentary published in the current issue of the american journal of medicine researchers from the charles e schmidt college of medicine at florida atlantic university reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline whose brand name is chantix is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease in 2006 varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent in 2009 however varenicline received a black box warning by the fda based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide there were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression nonetheless since then there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531000 in the first quarter of 2014 in their commentary the fau researchers emphasize that until recently the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials which did not demonstrate a hazard the researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from largescale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis such a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness the trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8000 longterm smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders in subjects without psychiatric disorders those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo nicotine patch or bupropion just a few months ago the fda removed the black box warning from varenicline the commentary was coauthored by dianna gaballa a fourthyear medical student joanna drowos do mph an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the department of integrated medical science and charles h hennekens md drph the first sir richard doll professor and senior academic advisor to the dean all in faus charles e schmidt college of medicine the existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population in part because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent said hennekens quitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the nonsmoker status within a few years even among older adults for lung and other cancers however reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and even after 10 years quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and nonsmoker for reducing risks of cardiovascular disease its never too late to quit but to reduce risks of cancer its never too early said hennekens the authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009 perhaps 17000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the us while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries
fake,newswise san francisco march 16 2017patients in their 80s and 90s who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation can be treated safely and effectively with stereotactic body radiation therapy sbrt according to research presented today at the 2017 multidisciplinary thoracic cancers symposium the advanced form of radiation therapy rt was well tolerated among this relatively understudied elderly population indicating that sbrt is a viable option for patients who may otherwise be offered no curative treatment while the primary treatment for early stage lung cancer is surgical removal of the tumor some patients may not be able to tolerate surgery due to health status advanced age or other factors for these patients the best curative option is sbrt a specialized type of external beam rt that uses advanced imaging techniques to deliver extremely targeted radiation to a tumor this high degree of precision makes sbrt particularly effective at sparing surrounding healthy tissue which is important for tumor sites near essential organs such as the heart and lungs patients complete sbrt treatment in three to five days compared with several weeks for conventional rt while multiple studies and trials have established the effectiveness of sbrt for inoperable earlystage lung cancer one of the common reasons for not giving radiation in older patients is concern about tolerating the treatment and potential side effects said richard j cassidy iii md lead author of the study and a resident in radiation oncology at emory universitys winship cancer institute in atlanta the low rates of side effects from sbrt for this elderly population in our study indicate that these concerns should not prevent physicians from considering definitive treatment for their inoperable octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with early stage lung cancer findings are based on a retrospective analysis of 58 consecutive patients who received definitive lung sbrt across four academic sites within emory between 2010 and 2015 all patients were age 80 or older at the time of their diagnosis with a median age of 849 years forty percent of the tumors were adenocarcinomas while 29 percent were squamous cell carcinomas and 31 percent did not have a biopsy fifty percent of patients who did not have a biopsy had a previous history of lung cancer researchers used logistic regression and proportional hazard testing to determine the association of patient tumor and treatment characteristics to compare rates of survival recurrence and progression and assess the influence of patient and disease characteristics recursive partitioning analysis rpa was conducted to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from therapy at two years following definitive sbrt for lung cancer among elderly patients survival rates were 73 percent for cancer specific survival css and 57 percent for overall survival os css rates were higher for patients who were not active smokers

fake,what is the effect of topical curcumin gel for treating burns and scalds in a recent research paper published in the open access journal biodiscovery dr madalene heng clinical professor of dermatology at the david geffen school of medicine stresses that use of topical curcumin gel for treating skin problems like burns and scalds is very different and appears to work more effectively when compared to taking curcumin tablets by mouth for other conditions curcumin gel appears to work much better when used on the skin because the gel preparation allows curcumin to penetrate the skin inhibit phosphorylase kinase and reduce inflammation explains dr heng in this report use of curcumin after burns and scalds were found to reduce the severity of the injury lessen pain and inflammation and improve healing with less than expected scarring or even no scarring of the affected skin dr heng reports her experience using curcumin gel on such injuries using three examples of patients treated after burns and scalds and provides a detailed explanation why topical curcumin may work on such injuries curcumin is an ingredient found in the common spice turmeric turmeric has been used as a spice for centuries in many eastern countries and gives well known dishes such as curry their typical yellowgold color the spice has also been used for cosmetic and medical purposes for just as long in these countries in recent years the medicinal value of curcumin has been the subject of intense scientific studies with publication numbering in the thousands looking into the possible beneficial effects of this natural product on many kinds of affliction in humans this study published reports that topical curcumin gel applied soon after mild to moderate burns and scalds appears to be remarkably effective in relieving symptoms and improved healing of the affected skin when taken by mouth curcumin is very poorly absorbed into the body and may not work as well notes dr heng nonetheless our tests have shown that when the substance is used in a topical gel the effect is notable the author of the study believes that the effectiveness of curcumin gel on the skin or topical curcumin is related to its potent antiinflammatory activity based on studies that she has done both in the laboratory and in patients over 25 years the key to curcumins effectiveness on burns and scalds is that it is a natural inhibitor of an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase this enzyme in humans has many important functions including its involvement in wound healing wound healing is the vital process that enables healing of tissues after injury the process goes through a sequence of acute and chronic inflammatory events during which there is redness swelling pain and then healing often with scarring in the case of burns and scalds of the skin the sequence is started by the release of phosphorylase kinase about 5 mins after injury which activates over 200 genes that are involved in wound healing dr heng uses curcumin gel for burns scalds and other skin conditions as complementary treatment in addition to standard treatment usually recommended for such conditions
fake,drinking concentrated blueberry juice improves brain function in older people according to research by the university of exeter in the study healthy people aged 6577 who drank concentrated blueberry juice every day showed improvements in cognitive function blood flow to the brain and activation of the brain while carrying out cognitive tests there was also evidence suggesting improvement in working memory blueberries are rich in flavonoids which possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties dr joanna bowtell head of sport and health sciences at the university of exeter said our cognitive function tends to decline as we get older but previous research has shown that cognitive function is better preserved in healthy older adults with a diet rich in plantbased foods in this study we have shown that with just 12 weeks of consuming 30ml of concentrated blueberry juice every day brain blood flow brain activation and some aspects of working memory were improved in this group of healthy older adults of the 26 healthy adults in the study 12 were given concentrated blueberry juice providing the equivalent of 230g of blueberries once a day while 14 received a placebo before and after the 12week period participants took a range of cognitive tests while an mri scanner monitored their brain function and resting brain blood flow was measured compared to the placebo group those who took the blueberry supplement showed significant increases in brain activity in brain areas related to the tests the study excluded anyone who said they consumed more than five portions of fruit and vegetables per day and all participants were told to stick to their normal diet throughout previous research has shown that risk of dementia is reduced by higher fruit and vegetable intake and cognitive function is better preserved in healthy older adults with a diet rich in plantbased foods flavonoids which are abundant in plants are likely to be an important component in causing these effects
fake,newswise arlington va march 1 2017 results from a new prospective clinical trial indicate that highdoserate hdr brachytherapy administered in a single 19 gray gy treatment may be a safe and effective alternative to longer courses of hdr treatment for men with localized prostate cancer the study is available online in the international journal of radiation oncology biology physics the flagship journal of the american society for radiation oncology astro with brachytherapy also known as internal radiation therapy rt implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate which is surrounded by multiple critical structures in contrast to lowdoserate ldr brachytherapy where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months hdr treatments deposit the dose in one treatment after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient typically hdr brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants while the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited in this study researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 gy hdr brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with ldr brachytherapy but with the convenience of a single visit it is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure said lead study author daniel j krauss md a radiation oncologist at oakland universitys william beaumont school of medicine in royal oak michigan we found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects the study which appeared in the red journals january 2017 issue presented the results of a nonrandomized prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low or intermediaterisk nonmetastatic prostate cancer with a median followup period of 29 years all patients received a single 19 gy fraction of hdr brachytherapy the median patient age was 63 years range 4373 and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage t1 disease at an average of nearly three years following treatment cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable three patients experienced recurrence or progression yielding an estimated threeyear cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent within the six months following hdr therapy seven patients 121 experienced grade 2 urinary side effects most commonly frequencyurgency 69 no patients experienced shortterm grade 3 urinary toxicity or grade 2 gastrointestinal gi toxicity rates were similarly modest for longterm side effects six patients 103 experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient 17 experienced grade 3 chronic gi toxicity that subsequently resolved no patients experienced longterm grade 3 urinary toxicity or grade 4 gi toxicity this study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration said dr krauss giving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostatemeaning the bladder urethra and rectumbut this was not found to be the case toxicity rates were extremely low with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients while findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of hdr brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer the article also emphasizes the need for additional followup to compare longterm cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 gy dose used in this trial as the followup interval lengthens 19 gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards one thing that this study has made clear however is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials said dr krauss while additional study and longer followup are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for singlefraction hdr brachytherapy we are optimistic that the singletreatment

fake,what if you could lose weight and reduce your risk of lifethreatening disease without any changes in what you eat other than a fiveday special diet once every few months thats what happened for 71 adults who were placed on three cycles of a lowcalorie fastingmimicking diet the phase ii trial conducted by researchers at the usc leonard davis school of gerontology demonstrated a host of benefits from the regimen the diet reduced cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure signs of inflammation measured by creactive protein levels as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of igf1 a hormone that affects metabolism it also shrank waistlines and resulted in weight loss both in total body fat and trunk fat but not in muscle mass in effect the diet reduced the study participants risks for cancer diabetes heart disease and other agerelated diseases according to the findings published feb 15 in science translational medicine this study provides evidence that people can experience significant health benefits through a periodic fastingmimicking diet that is designed to act on the aging process said valter longo director of the usc longevity institute and a professor of biological sciences for usc davis and dornsife prior studies have indicated a range of health benefits in mice but this is the first randomized clinical trial with enough participants to demonstrate that the diet is feasible effective and safe for humans larger fda studies are necessary to confirm its effects on disease prevention and treatment he added one hundred people participated in the trial from april 2013 to july 2015 the participants ages 20 to 70 and all generally healthy were divided into two groups for the randomized trial participants in the first group the control group were asked to continue their normal eating habits for three months people in the second group were placed on a threemonth test of the fastingmimicking diet those on the special diet were required to eat food products supplied by the nutrition company lnutra during the fasting periods of five days each month the diet which was designed to mimic the results of a wateronly fast allowed for participants to consume between 750 and 1100 calories per day the meals for the fastmimicking diet contained precise proportions of proteins fats and carbohydrates after three months participants in the control group were moved onto the special diet the researchers found that participants on the fastingmimicking diet lost an average of about 6 pounds their waistlines shrank by 1 to 2 inches their systolic blood pressure which was in the normal range when the study began dropped by 45 mmhg while their diastolic blood pressure dropped by 31 mmhg also their levels of igf1 dropped to between 217 ngml and 462 ngml reaching a range associated with lower cancer risk after the first group completed their three months on the fasting diet we moved over participants in the control group to see if they also would experience similar results longo said we saw similar outcomes which provides further evidence that a fastingmimicking diet has effects on many metabolic and disease markers our mouse studies using a similar fastingmimicking diet indicate that these beneficial effects are caused by multisystem regeneration and rejuvenation in the body at the cellular and organ levels our participants retained those effects even when they returned to their normal daily eating habits he added the researchers also noted that participants considered at risk because they had risk factors such as high igf1 cholesterol blood pressure or blood sugar levels made significant progress toward better health for example baseline fasting glucose levels for participants with high blood sugar levels putting them at risk for diabetes dropped into the healthy range below 99 mgdl but these levels didnt drop among participants who already had healthy levels at the beginning of the study cholesterol was reduced by 20 mgdl in those with high cholesterol levels and by about 5 mgdl in all participants fasting seems to be the most beneficial for patients who have the great risk factors for disease such as those who have high blood pressure or prediabetes or who are obese longo said the researchers had invited participants in the study for one last set of tests three months later at the end of the diet the research team found that the beneficial effects from weight loss smaller waistlines and lower glucose blood pressure and igf1 levels were sustained the next step for researchers is a large fda phase iii clinical trial to test the fmd on patients diagnosed with agerelated diseases or at high risk for them the researchers said further investigation will determine whether the benefits of the diet can continue for several months

immunosuppressive therapy followed by transplantation of a persons own bloodforming stem cells can induce sustained remission of relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis ms an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system these fiveyear results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing longterm sustained remissions of poorprognosis relapsingremitting ms five years after receiving the treatment called highdose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplant hdithct 69 percent of trial participants had survived without experiencing progression of disability relapse of ms symptoms or new brain lesions notably participants did not take any ms medications after receiving hdithct other studies have indicated that currently available ms drugs have lower success rates the trial called haltms was sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid part of the national institutes of health and conducted by the niaidfunded immune tolerance network itn the researchers published threeyear results from the study in december 2014 and the final fiveyear results appear online feb 1 in neurology the medical journal of the american academy of neurology these extended findings suggest that onetime treatment with hdithct may be substantially more effective than longterm treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of ms said niaid director anthony s fauci md these encouraging results support the development of a large randomized trial to directly compare hdithct to standard of care for this oftendebilitating disease ms symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties weakness fatigue and chronic pain the most common form of ms is relapsingremitting ms which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flareups or relapses over years the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form in haltms researchers tested the safety efficacy and durability of hdithct in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsingremitting ms who despite taking clinically available medications experienced active inflammation evidenced by frequent severe relapses and worsened neurological disability the experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing diseasecausing cells and resetting the immune system during the procedure doctors collect a participants bloodforming stem cells give the participant highdose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system and return the participants own stem cells to rebuild the immune system the treatment carries some risks and many participants experienced the expected side effects of hdithct such as infections three participants died during the study none of the deaths were related to the study treatment five years after hdithct most trial participants remained in remission and their ms had stabilized in addition some participants showed improvements such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities although further evaluation of the benefits and risks of hdithct is needed these fiveyear results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing longterm sustained remissions of poorprognosis relapsingremitting ms said richard nash md of colorado blood cancer institute and presbyterianst lukes hospital dr nash served as principal investigator of the haltms study if these findings are confirmed in larger studies hdithct may become a potential therapeutic option for patients with active

fake,a new method of stimulating the renewal of living stem cells in tooth pulp using an alzheimers drug has been discovered by a team of researchers at kings college london following trauma or an infection the inner soft pulp of a tooth can become exposed and infected in order to protect the tooth from infection a thin band of dentine is naturally produced and this seals the tooth pulp but it is insufficient to effectively repair large cavities currently dentists use manmade cements or fillings such as calcium and siliconbased products to treat these larger cavities and fill holes in teeth this cement remains in the tooth and fails to disintegrate meaning that the normal mineral level of the tooth is never completely restored however in a paper published today in scientific reports scientists from the dental institute at kings college london have proven a way to stimulate the stem cells contained in the pulp of the tooth and generate new dentine the mineralised material that protects the tooth in large cavities potentially reducing the need for fillings or cements the novel biological approach could see teeth use their natural ability to repair large cavities rather than using cements or fillings which are prone to infections and often need replacing a number of times indeed when fillings fail or infection occurs dentists have to remove and fill an area that is larger than what is affected and after multiple treatments the tooth may eventually need to be extracted as this new method encourages natural tooth repair it could eliminate all of these issues providing a more natural solution for patients significantly one of the small molecules used by the team to stimulate the renewal of the stem cells included tideglusib which has previously been used in clinical trials to treat neurological disorders including alzheimers disease this presents a real opportunity to fasttrack the treatment into practice using biodegradable collagen sponges to deliver the treatment the team applied low doses of small molecule glycogen synthase kinase gsk3 to the tooth they found that the sponge degraded over time and that new dentine replaced it leading to complete natural repair collagen sponges are commerciallyavailable and clinicallyapproved again adding to the potential of the treatments swift pickup and use in dental clinics lead author of the study professor paul sharpe from kings college london said the simplicity of our approach makes it ideal as a clinical dental product for the natural treatment of large cavities by providing both pulp protection and restoring dentine in addition using a drug that has already been tested in clinical trials for alzheimers disease provides a real opportunity to get this dental treatment quickly into clinics

fake,oakland ca january 3 2017 a new study by researchers from the ucsf benioff childrens hospital oakland research institute chori shows that a modest 4 milligrams of extra zinc a day in the diet can have a profound positive impact on cellular health that helps fight infections and diseases this amount of zinc is equivalent to what biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat can add to the diet of vulnerable nutrient deficient populations the study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition was led by chori senior scientist janet king phd king and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to dna we were pleasantly surprised to see that just a small increase in dietary zinc can have such a significant impact on how metabolism is carried out throughout the body says king these results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that foodbased interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide zinc is ubiquitous in our body and facilitates many functions that are essential for preserving life it plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth and in ensuring a healthy immune system zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers around much of the world many households eat polished white rice or highly refined wheat or maize flours which provide energy but do not provide enough essential micronutrients such as zinc zinc is an essential part of nearly 3000 different proteins and it impacts how these proteins regulate every cell in our body in the absence of sufficient zinc our ability to repair everyday wear and tear on our dna is compromised in the randomized controlled sixweek study the scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism by counting dna strand breaks they used the parameter of dna damage to examine the influence of a moderate amount of zinc on healthy living this was a novel approach different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status according to king these results are relevant to the planning and evaluation of foodbased solutions for mitigating the impact of hidden hunger and malnutrition king believes that biofortification can be a sustainable longterm solution to zinc deficiency
fake,tampa fla jan 3 2016 deregulation and inhibition of the immune system contributes to cancer development many therapeutic strategies aim to restimulate the immune system to recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction researchers from moffitt cancer center report that a dendritic cell vaccine that targets the her2 protein on breast cancer cells is safe and effectively stimulates the immune system leading to regression of earlystage breast cancer the her2 protein is overexpressed in 2025 of all breast cancer tumors and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis researchers have previously shown that immune cells are less able to recognize and target cancer cells that express her2 as breast cancer progresses into a more advanced and invasive stage this suggests that strategies that can restimulate the immune system to recognize and target her2 early during cancer development may be effective treatment options the researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the her2 protein on breast cancer cells their approach involves creating the vaccine from immune cells called dendritic cells that are harvested from each individual patient to create a personalized vaccine in order to determine if the her2dendritic cell vaccine is safe and effective the researchers performed a clinical trial in 54 women who have her2expressing earlystage breast cancer the dendritic cell vaccines were prepared by isolating dendritic cells from each patients blood and exposing them to fragments of the her2 protein patients were injected with a dose of their personal dendritic cell vaccine once a week for 6 weeks into either a lymph node the breast tumor or into both sites the researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were welltolerated and patients only experienced lowgrade toxicities the most common adverse events were fatigue injection site reactions and chills they also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients approximately 80 of evaluable patients had a detectable immune response in their peripheral blood andor in their sentinel lymph node wherein their cancer is most likely to spread to first importantly the immune responses among the patients were similar regardless of the route of vaccine administration the moffitt researchers assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine by determining the percentage of patients who had detectable disease within surgical specimens after resection the absence of disease is termed a pathological complete response pcr they report that 13 patients achieved a pcr and patients who had early noninvasive disease called ductal carcinoma in situ dcis achieved a higher rate of pcr than patients who had earlystage invasive disease interestingly patients who achieved a pcr had a higher immune response within their local sentinel lymph nodes these results suggest that vaccines are more effective in dcis thereby warranting further evaluation in dcis or other minimal disease settings and the local regional sentinel lymph node may serve as a more meaningful immunologic endpoint said brian j czerniecki md phd chair of the department of breast oncology at moffitt cancer center
fake,epa and dha omega3s reduce the risk of coronary heart disease chd according to results of a new comprehensive metaanalysis published in the mayo clinic proceedings among randomized controlled trials rcts there was a statistically significant reduction in chd risk in higher risk populations including 16 percent in those with high triglycerides and 14 percent in those with high ldl cholesterol a nonstatistically significant 6 percent risk reduction among all populations in rcts a finding supported by a statistically significant 18 percent reduced risk of chd among prospective cohort studies what makes this paper unique is that it looked at the effects of epa and dha on coronary heart disease specifically which is an important nuance considering coronary heart disease accounts for half of all cardiovascular deaths in the us said dr dominik alexander lead author and principal epidemiologist for epidstat the 6 percent reduced risk among rcts coupled with an 18 percent risk reduction in prospective cohort studies which tend to include more reallife dietary scenarios over longer periods tell a compelling story about the importance of epa and dha omega3s for cardiovascular health additional study details include the study reviewed 18 randomized controlled trials rcts and 16 prospective cohort studies with 93000 and 732000 subjects respectively the study examined outcomes such as myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death and coronary death the study compared the results of rcts which explore interventions under strict clinical conditions to those of prospective cohort studies that are observational and followed larger populations for longer periods of time there are important public health implications related to reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and therefore we are encouraged by the results of this comprehensive analysis said dr harry rice vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs for the global organization for epa and dha omega3s goed which funded the study its also important that the observed risk reductions were even stronger in patient populations with elevated triglycerides and ldl cholesterol levels two risk factors that affect more than one quarter of the american population the results confirm that increasing omega3s is a healthy lifestyle intervention that can contribute towards reductions in chd risk added adam ismail executive director of goed remember that increasing omega3 intakes is basically just improving the quality of ones diet slightly like reducing the amount of sodium or increasing your dietary fiber it is a simple inexpensive and achievable change that most consumers need to make to optimize their health an accompanying editorial in mayo clinic proceedings also acknowledges the importance of the study the metaanalyses of alexander and colleagues suggests that omega3 fatty acid intake may reduce risk of adverse chd events especially among people with elevated levels of tgs or ldlcomega3 fatty acid intake of at least 1 gram of epadha per day either from seafood or supplementation as recommended by the american heart association continues to be a reasonable strategy said the authors study authors did point out that further clinical trials looking specifically at chd outcomes may continue to provide a better understanding of the promising beneficial relationship between epadha and chd risk current rcts have varying durations different baseline chd status for study participants and utilize several methods for patient selection and randomization future studies should increase patient populations to account for dropout rates in longer trials extensively detail how subjects are diagnosed to create uniform diagnostic criteria be appropriately powered to detect an effect in current clinical conditions measure baseline omega3 intake or status of study participants to determine the extent to which it confounds results
fake,what a new study shows that the drug fenofibrate might reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who have high levels of triglycerides and low levels of good cholesterol despite being treated with statins the study funded by the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi appears in the december 28 issue of jama cardiology fenofibrate is primarily used to help reduce elevated levels of triglycerides or fat in the blood but the researchers wanted to know if the drug when combined with statin treatment could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes people with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascularrelated events such as heart attacks stroke and even death often because their levels of triglycerides are so high and their highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels are low to answer their question the researchers followed 4640 participants from the nhlbifunded action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes accord lipid study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009 the findings suggest that fenofibrate therapy may be beneficial in the way the researchers hoped by reducing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who take statins but still have especially high triglycerides levels and low hdl cholesterol levels however a randomized study is needed to confirm these findings according to the authors

fake,december 8 2016 by samantha bonar newswise city of hope patient susan young has had a remarkable response to a potentially revolutionary new treatment a combination of the p53 cancer vaccine and a drug that blocks a specific canceraiding protein the 69yearold came to city of hope in august 2016 from uc davis with advanced triplenegative breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones and skin she had exhausted all of her chemotherapy options and this experimental treatment was her last hope the only other option was hospice at least 60 to 70 percent of her body was covered by lesions inflammation and thickened purplish skin said yuan yuan md breast cancer oncologist at city of hope who treated young six weeks into her treatment the skin lesions were gone her itchiness went away its quite a dramatic response so dramatic in fact that yuan refers to young as her miracle patient this in some ways is pretty unprecedented this patient is at a late stage of her disease there are no treatments available that would have done the same thing said don j diamond phd chair of the department of experimental therapeutics at city of hope young received a combination of the p53 vaccine and the drug pembrolizumab diamond developed the vaccine and has been studying its effectiveness in clinical trials at coh since 2010 he currently is testing it on ovarian cancer and other solid tumors such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal masses ive responded great im feeling good said young who has received six of seven pembrolizumab infusions each of which takes about a halfhour and all three p53 vaccine injections my skin has cleared up i think the prognosis is going to be good now teaching the immune system to fight the most frequent mutation across all cancers occurs in a gene called p53 which contributes to cells becoming oncogenic when they produce a mutant form of the p53 protein p53 gene mutations are present in about 50 of malignancies diamonds vaccine boosts the immune response to many different mutant forms of p53 the researchers tested this vaccine known as p53mva in a 2013 clinical trial and found it to be safe in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers however patients whose t cells had preexisting high levels of a protein named pd1 a molecule that instructs immune cells to shut down responded poorly to the antip53 vaccine in a subsequent laboratory study the coh researchers showed that these patients immune cells could be reactivated by treatment with a pd1 inhibitor that is a biosimilar to the clinical drug called pembrolizumab together the vaccine and the drug potentially could form a potent team to reactivate the immune system to quickly clear out cancer cells before young the combination had been tried on patients with recurrent solid tumors such as nonsmall cell lung cancer melanoma renal cell carcinoma and many other cancer types so far while diamond has noted an immune response in patients given the combination treatment in clinical trials he has not seen a clinical benefit that is until he met young we have treated a number of different types of patients with the combination but nothing is even in the same universe as this he said a shocking response young who tested positive for the p53 mutation has been fighting breast cancer for eight years and has undergone one chemo after another yuan said referred to city of hope by her physician at davis she began responding to the experimental treatment right away yuan said her skin tumors disappearing and the latest biopsies showing no cancer the purple thickened skin has faded away the skin color has normalized shes healed basically she said its such a promising early response its quite unusual she added we have two drugs here so its hard to dissect which drug did what but we do think the vaccine played a key role it was shocking to me said diamond what we have noticed is that her immune response to p53 has been increasing as time goes on it was of tremendous magnitude in the last blood draw the next step will be to take bone and ct scans to see if the cancer is disappearing internally as well as externally which young will receive in a couple of weeks even now though young is extremely happy with the results yuan said her psychological wellbeing has improved her appetite is better shes more functional she went through a lot it will be very interesting to follow up i couldnt look at myself it was really hard young said of the skin lesions she had endured for five years they started to go away after the third treatment she said even the marks where it was climbing up my neck are all gonefurther study needed what diamond is hoping for now is funding for a full clinical trial so that he can test the combination in advanced triplenegative breast cancer patients who test positive for p53 a couple of major drug companies have already expressed interest in his vaccine he said what we would like is to have women come here from all over the country and the world to receive this vaccine formula so that we can test this combination diamond said if it happened once maybe it will happen twice but weve got to get these patients in following the success in young the formula has recently been given to two other triple negative breast cancer patients at city of hope its too early to gauge the response although the entire breast team is very excited about this diamond said we saw this phenomenal response in this patient i am very encouraged by the findings so i think theres a story to come everything is turning around for me young said i was very frightened when i started out im not that frightened anymore i know it still can turn for me but i think im going to be the miracle that dr yuan wants miracle patient finds new hope with breast cancer vaccine
fake,a new nonsurgical treatment for lowrisk prostate cancer can effectively kill cancer cells while preserving healthy tissue reports a new uclled phase iii clinical trial in 413 patients the trial was funded by steba biotech which holds the commercial license for the treatment the new treatment vasculartargeted photodynamic therapy vtp involves injecting a lightsensitive drug into the bloodstream and then activating it with a laser to destroy tumour tissue in the prostate the research published in the lancet oncology found that around half 49 of patients treated with vtp went into complete remission compared with 135 in the control group these results are excellent news for men with early localised prostate cancer offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate says lead investigator professor mark emberton dean of ucl medical sciences and consultant urologist at uclh this is truly a huge leap forward for prostate cancer treatment which has previously lagged decades behind other solid cancers such as breast cancer in 1975 almost everyone with breast cancer was given a radical mastectomy but since then treatments have steady improved and we now rarely need to remove the whole breast in prostate cancer we are still commonly removing or irradiating the whole prostate so the success of this new tissuepreserving treatment is welcome news indeed at the moment men with lowrisk prostate cancer are put under active surveillance where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe radical therapy which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate has significant longterm side effects so is only used to treat highrisk cancers radical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and around one in five patients also suffer from incontinence by contrast vtp only caused shortterm urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months and no significant sideeffects remained after two years in the trial only 6 of patients treated with vtp needed radical therapy compared with 30 of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance the chances of cancer progressing to a more dangerous stage were three times lower for patients on vtp and the treatment doubled the average time to progression from 14 months to 28 months the trial involved 47 treatment sites from ten different european countries most of which were performing vtp for the first time the fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by nonspecialist centres in various health systems is really remarkable says professor emberton who is supported by the national institute for health research university college london hospitals biomedical research centre new procedures are generally associated with a learning curve but the lack of complications in the trial suggests that the treatment protocol is safe efficient and relatively easy to scale up we would also expect the treatment to be far more precise if we repeated it today as technology has come a long way since the study began in 2011 we can now pinpoint prostate cancers using mri scans and targeted biopsies allowing a much more targeted approach to diagnosis and treatment this means we could accurately identify men who would benefit from vtp and deliver treatment more precisely to the tumour with such an approach we should be able to achieve a significantly higher remission rate than in the trial and send nearly all lowrisk localised prostate cancers into remission we also hope that vtp will be effective against other types of cancer the treatment was developed for prostate cancer because of the urgent need for new therapies but it should be translatable to other solid cancers including breast and liver cancer the vtp therapy approach was developed by scientists at the weizmann institute of science in israel in collaboration with steba biotech and the european phase i ii and iii trials were all led by ucl the drug used in the procedure wst11 is derived from bacteria at the bottom of the ocean to survive with very little sunlight they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency this property has been exploited to develop wst11 a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light one of the first people to be treated with vtp was uclh patient gerald a man in his sixties who took part in the latest trial under the care of professor emberton he says when i was diagnosed with early prostate cancer i had the option of active surveillance but i didnt want to wait until it got worse so when i was offered a place on the trial i signed up straight away some men prefer to delay treatment but i couldnt live with the fear of the cancer spreading until it either couldnt be treated or needed a treatment that would stop me living a normal life the treatment i received on the trial changed my life im now cancerfree with no sideeffects and dont have to worry about needing surgery in future i feel so lucky to be in this position ive met other men who had surgery they had to stay in hospital for days whereas i could go home the next day and one suffered from terrible incontinence which he found very distressing i had some minor sideeffects for a few weeks after the operation but im back to normal now i am incredibly grateful to professor mark emberton and his team for the excellent care that i received and i hope that other patients will be able to benefit from this treatment in future the vtp

fake,overweight people could be given help with the discovery that a drug used for sleep disorder could also reduce the impulse for food overweight people could be given help with the discovery that a drug used for sleep disorder could also reduce the impulse for food there are many factors that cause obesity but there is a growing weight of evidence that shows obesity is not just caused by a behavioural disorder such as a lack of selfcontrol but that many overweight people are physically addicted to foods rich in fat and sugar when we eat food that tastes good we get a powerful release of dopamine in the pleasurereward section of the brain but food addicts have been found to have a deficiency in a certain type of dopamine so that their sense of reward and pleasure is diminished thus they have to eat more to reach the same level of pleasure as anybody else scientists have also found impulsive behaviour is a factor in leading to food addiction and ivo vlaev of warwick business school plus myutan kulendran laura wingfield colin sugden and ara darzi of imperial college london discovered that a drug called modafinil usually used for narcolepsy shift work disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness can reduce impulsivity and thus food addiction we found modafinil which is already on the market did reduce peoples impulsive behaviour said professor vlaev it has been shown to reduce impulsiveness in a variety of disorders such as alcohol dependence schizophrenia and adhd food addicts suffer from the same neurobiological conditions so we believe it will help food addicts as well and our initial tests have backed up that theory this could have important implications for people who are obese there is mounting evidence to show that there is a substantial number of obese people who are food addicts because they have an inability to control their impulsive actions and this drug has shown it can give them more control which will help overweight people lose weight and so improve their health food addicts know they need to lose weight but the desire for more food is overwhelming leading to a spiral of depression that can lead to psychological issues as well as health problems the drug which is sold under a wide variety of brand names around the world was one of two drugs tested by researchers the other being atomoxetine both drugs have been used for impulsive conditions including adhd in the paper pharmacological manipulation of impulsivity a randomized controlled trial published in personality and individual differences the scientists conducted a series of trials on 60 men aged between 19 and 32 with 20 taking a placebo 20 atomoxetine and 20 modafinil the tests revealed that those who had taken modafinil had a significantly reduced level of impulsiveness whereas atomoxetine produced no difference compared to the placebo group modafinil was found to have an effect on impulsivity in healthy individuals and so would be able to have an even bigger effect on food addicts who are lacking in certain types of dopamine said professor vlaev this drug could be a real help to those people struggling to control their desire for food even though they know they should lose weight the drug improves selfcontrol which is a key factor in determining obesity so our hypothesis is that this drug should help in treating the disease
fake,running may also slow the process that leads to osteoarthritis we all know that running causes a bit of inflammation and soreness and thats just the price you pay for cardiovascular health you know no pain no gain well maybe not new research from byu exercise science professors finds that proinflammatory molecules actually go down in the knee joint after running in other words it appears running can reduce joint inflammation it flies in the face of intuition said study coauthor matt seeley associate professor of exercise science at byu this idea that longdistance running is bad for your knees might be a myth in a study recently published in the european journal of applied physiology seeley and a group of byu colleagues as well as dr eric robinson from intermountain healthcare measured inflammation markers in the knee joint fluid of several healthy men and women aged 1835 both before and after running the researchers found that the specific markers they were looking for in the extracted synovial fluidtwo cytokines named gmcsf and il15decreased in concentration in the subjects after 30 minutes of running when the same fluids were extracted before and after a nonrunning condition the inflammation markers stayed at similar levels what we now know is that for young healthy individuals exercise creates an antiinflammatory environment that may be beneficial in terms of longterm joint health said study lead author robert hyldahl byu assistant professor of exercise science hyldahl said the study results indicate running is chondroprotective which means exercise may help delay the onset of joint degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis this is potentially great news since osteoarthritisthe painful disease where cartilage at the end of bones wears down and gradually worsens over timeaffects about 27 million people in the united states this study does not indicate that distance runners are any more likely to get osteoarthritis than any other person seeley said instead this study suggests exercise can be a type of medicine researchers which included then undergraduate and now grad student alyssa evans and phd student sunku kwon now plan to turn their attention to study subjects with previous knee injuries specifically theyre looking to do similar tests on people who have suffered acl injuries byu professors sarah ridge and ty hopkins were also coauthors on the study

fake,a new norwegian diet intervention study fatfunc performed by researchers at the kg jebsen center for diabetes research at the university of bergen raises questions regarding the validity of a diet hypothesis that has dominated for more than half a century that dietary fat and particularly saturated fat is unhealthy for most people the researchers found strikingly similar health effects of diets based on either lowly processed carbohydrates or fats in the randomized controlled trial 38 men with abdominal obesity followed a dietary pattern high in either carbohydrates or fat of which about half was saturated fat mass in the abdominal region liver and heart was measured with accurate analyses along with a number of key risk factors for cardiovascular disease the very high intake of total and saturated fat did not increase the calculated risk of cardiovascular diseases says professor and cardiologist ottar nygrd who contributed to the study participants on the veryhighfat diet also had substantial improvements in several important cardiometabolic risk factors such as ectopic fat storage blood pressure blood lipids triglycerides insulin and blood sugar high quality food is healthier both groups had similar intakes of energy proteins polyunsaturated fatty acids the food types were the same and varied mainly in quantity and intake of added sugar was minimized we here looked at effects of total and saturated fat in the context of a healthy diet rich in fresh lowly processed and nutritious foods including high amounts of vegetables and rice instead of flourbased products says phd candidate vivian veum the fat sources were also lowly processed mainly butter cream and coldpressed oils total energy intake was within the normal range even the participants who increased their energy intake during the study showed substantial reductions in fat stores and disease risk our findings indicate that the overriding principle of a healthy diet is not the quantity of fat or carbohydrates but the quality of the foods we eat says phd candidate johnny laupsaborge saturated fat increases the good cholesterol saturated fat has been thought to promote cardiovascular diseases by raising the bad ldl cholesterol in the blood but even with a higher fat intake in the fatfunc study compared to most comparable studies the authors found no significant increase in ldl cholesterol rather the good cholesterol increased only on the veryhighfat diet these results indicate that most healthy people probably tolerate a high intake of saturated fat well as long as the fat quality is good and total energy intake is not too high it may even be healthy says ottar nygrd future studies should examine which people or patients may need to limit their intake of saturated fat assistant professor simon nitter dankel points out who led the study together with the director of the laboratory clinics professor gunnar mellgren at haukeland university hospital in bergen norway but the alleged health risks of eating goodquality fats have been greatly exaggerated it may be more important for public health to encourage reductions in processed flourbased products highly processed fats and foods with added sugar he says

fake,london on scientists from childrens health research institute a program of lawson health research institute and western university have developed a new blood test that identifies with greater than 90 per cent certainty whether or not an adolescent athlete has suffered a concussion diagnosis of a clinically significant concussion or a mild traumatic brain injury can be difficult as it currently relies on a combination of patient symptom assessment and clinician judgement equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury in the new study researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics dr douglas fraser a physician in the paediatric critical care unit at childrens hospital london health sciences centre and lawson scientist led the study with his coinvestigator mark daley a professor in the departments of computer science biology and statistics actuarial sciences at western university in the relatively inexpensive test blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body within 72 hours of the incident the scientists measure a panel of metabolites small molecules that are the products of the bodys metabolism in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred this novel approach to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results says dr fraser also an associate professor in westerns departments of paediatrics physiology pharmacology and clinical neurological sciences at the schulich school of medicine dentistry we looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion this new method fully funded by the childrens health foundation and conducted by the western concussion study group is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from nonconcussed adolescent patients in this latest successful attempt the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites we looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in nonconcussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different explains daley who is also westerns associate vicepresident research and a principal investigator at westerns renowned brain mind institute there is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from nonconcussed in fact with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 2040 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 per cent concussion is a major public health concern often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals longterm neurological dysfunction the discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important says dr fraser with further research we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion the findings were recently published in the international journal metabolomics the technology is subject to a patent application filed through worldiscoveries the joint technology transfer office of lawson and western this relatively quick and inexpensive blood test for concussion is by far the most accurate reported with tremendous potential for clinical management and commercialization says kirk brown manager of business development for lawson

fake,a study coordinated by the musc health weight management center shows the scales tipping in weight watchers favor instead of standard care when it comes to helping people with type 2 diabetes patrick oneil phd directs the weight management center and led the 16site study results were published november 2 in the obesity journal while the weight management center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes many people with the condition dont live near a specialized program and need help thats readily available oneil said because weight watchers has centers all over the country including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetesspecific counseling thats why he said it was important for musc to be involved in the study which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program weight watchers promoting healthy communities is part of muscs mission the multisite studys results were statistically and clinically significant oneil said the weight watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care they achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight he said they still had diabetes but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking the studys 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctors care for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes half got standard care a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials the other half went to weight watchers meetings had access to weight watchers online materials and had two phone consultations and followup email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the weight watchers plan to help with their diabetes participants had four followup visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes after a year people in the weight watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight compared to 2 percent for the standard care group the weight watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of longterm control of their blood sugar which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to type 2 diabetes left uncontrolled the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke it can also cause eye problems kidney damage and even lead to amputations risk factors for type 2 diabetes include being overweight not getting enough exercise being 45 or older having a family member with type 2 diabetes certain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk including africanamericans and hispanics unlike type 1 diabetes which is caused by an immune reaction type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years so incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the muscled study are important it wasnt a huge overwhelming difference oneil said but it was scalable meaning it could be applied to the whole population the whole population of people with type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million americans its by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about 85000 in medical costs diabetes is a growing problem oneil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012 weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression the musc health weight management center takes a scientific approach to weight loss focusing on changes in activity levels behavior thinking diet and support systems oneil said its important to help people not blame them the weight watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain type 2 diabetes you do have some power and control he said you can lose some weight and lower your blood sugar and may even be able to change your medications thats no small feat in treating diabetes
fake,newswise new orleans nov 4 2016 patients with obesity who swallowed gasfilled balloon capsules designed to help them eat less lost 19 times more weight than patients who relied on diet exercise and lifestyle therapy alone according to new research presented today at obesityweek 2016 the largest international event focused on the basic science clinical application and prevention and treatment of obesity the annual conference is hosted by the american society for metabolic and bariatric surgery asmbs and the obesity society tos the significant weight loss achieved with the obalon 6month balloon system is maintained at 12 months said aurora pryor md study coauthor and chief bariatric foregut and advanced gi surgery stony brook university this combination of lifestyle modification and balloon therapy provides a new low risk option for patients struggling with obesity the obalon 6month balloon system a swallowable gasfilled intragastric balloon for weight loss in adults with obesity for whom diet and exercise has failed was approved in september by the us food and drug administration fda it involves a balloon contained within a capsule that once it reaches the stomach is inflated with gas via a microcatheter up to three balloons may be placed over the first three months but the entire treatment period lasts six months the inflated balloons make patients feel full treatment is accompanied by a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program the device is manufactured by obalon therapeutics inc based in san diego ca results of the study were based on a doubleblinded randomized shamcontrolled trial of 387 patients about half of whom received treatment with the obalon balloon and the other half with a sugarfilled sham capsule designed to look like the device patients who had a body mass index bmi of between 30 and 40 swallowed three capsules over a 12week period one every three weeks all patients at the 15 study sites also underwent 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy administered by a blinded registered dietitian every three weeks after six months patients were informed which capsule they received and those with the obalon balloons had them removed endoscopically average percent total weight loss after six months for obalon balloon patients was 681 percent while those in the sham control group had 359 percent total average weight loss balloontreated patients had nearly 25 percent excess weight loss six months after the balloons were removed 895 percent of the average total weight lost during the treatment period was maintained researchers say a single adverse event a bleeding gastric ulcer occurred in one balloon patient on high dose nsaids who had an outpatient knee replacement procedure nonserious adverse device events mostly abdominal cramping and nausea occurred in 908 percent of patients 996 were rated mild or moderate there is no magic pill for obesity but this swallowable balloon and other intragastric balloons may offer new hope to people who otherwise would not seek treatment or not have as good a result with diet and exercise alone said raul j rosenthal md asmbs president and chairman department of general surgery cleveland clinic florida who was not involved in the study the balloon and other technologies may help to fill the therapeutic gaps between diet and exercise and medical therapy and medical therapy and surgery where the gaps are quite large people with obesity and severe obesity have higher rates of heart disease diabetes some cancers arthritis sleep apnea high blood pressure and dozens of other diseases and conditions studies have shown individuals with a bmi greater than 30 have a 50 to 100 percent greater risk of premature death compared to healthy weight individuals12 metabolicbariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lasting treatment for severe obesity and many related conditions and results in significant weight loss the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq reported significant improvements in the safety of metabolicbariatric surgery due in large part to improved laparoscopic techniques3 the risk of death is about 01 percent4 and the overall likelihood of major complications is about 4 percent5 according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in 20112014 the prevalence of obesity was just over 36

fake,in the first controlled clinical trial of nicotinamide riboside nr a newly discovered form of vitamin b3 researchers have shown that the compound is safe for humans and increases levels of a cell metabolite that is critical for cellular energy production and protection against stress and dna damage studies in mice have shown that boosting the levels of this cell metaboliteknown as nadcan produce multiple health benefits including resistance to weight gain improved control of blood sugar and cholesterol reduced nerve damage and longer lifespan levels of nad diminish with age and it has been suggested that loss of this metabolite may play a role in agerelated health decline these findings in animal studies have spurred people to take commercially available nr supplements designed to boost nad however these overthecounter supplements have not undergone clinical trials to see if they work in people the new research reported oct 10 in the journal nature communications was led by charles brenner phd professor and roy j carver chair of biochemistry at the university of iowa carver college of medicine in collaboration with colleagues at queens university belfast and chromadex corp nasdaq cdxc which supplied the nr used in the trial brenner is a consultant for chromadex he also is cofounder and chief scientific adviser of prohealthspan which sells nr supplements under the trade name tru niagen the human trial involved six men and six women all healthy each participant received single oral doses of 100 mg 300 mg or 1000 mg of nr in a different sequence with a sevenday gap between doses after each dose blood and urine samples were collected and analyzed by brenners lab to measure various nad metabolites in a process called metabolomics the trial showed that the nr vitamin increased nad metabolism by amounts directly related to the dose and there were no serious side effects with any of the doses this trial shows that oral nr safely boosts human nad metabolism brenner says we are excited because everything we are learning from animal systems indicates that the effectiveness of nr depends on preserving andor boosting nad and related compounds in the face of metabolic stresses because the levels of supplementation in mice that produce beneficial effects are achievable in people it appears than health benefits of nr will be translatable to humans safely the next step will be to study the effect of longer duration nr supplementation on nad metabolism in healthy adults but brenner also has plans to test the effects of nr in people with diseases and health conditions including elevated cholesterol obesity and diabetes and people at risk for chemotherapeutic peripheral neuropathy selfstudy precedes clinical trial prior to the formal clinical trial brenner conducted a pilot human study on himself in 2004 he had discovered that nr is a natural product found in milk and that there is pathway to convert nr to nad in people more than a decade of research on nr metabolic pathways and health effects in mice and rats had convinced him that nr supplementation had real promise to improve human health and wellness after consulting with uis institutional review board he conducted an experiment in which he took 1 gram of nr once a day for seven days and his team analyzed blood and urine samples using mass spectrometry the experiment showed that brenners blood nad increased by about 27 times in addition though he reported immediate sensitivity to flushing with the related compound niacin he did not experience any side effects taking nr the biggest surprise from his metabolomic analysis was an increase in a metabolite called naad which was multiplied by 45 times from trace levels to amounts in the micromolar range that were easily detectable while this was unexpected i thought it might be useful brenner says nad is an abundant metabolite and it is sometimes hard to see the needle move on levels of abundant metabolites but when you can look at a lowabundance metabolite that goes from undetectable to easily detectable there is a great signal to noise ratio meaning that naad levels could be a useful biomarker for tracking increases in nad in human trials brenner notes this was a case of bidirectional translational science having learned something from the initial human experiment his team was able to return to laboratory mice to explore the unexpected naad finding in more detail first mice then men and women brenners mouse study showed that naad is formed from nr and confirmed that naad levels are a strong biomarker for increased nad metabolism the experiments also revealed more detail about nad metabolic pathways in particular the researchers compared the ability of all three nad precursor vitamins nr niacin and nicotinamide to boost nad metabolism and stimulate the activity of certain enzymes which have been linked to longevity and health benefits the study showed for the first time that oral nr is superior to nicotinamide which is better than niacin in terms of the total amount of nad produced at an equivalent dose nr was also the best of the three in stimulating the activity of sirtuin enzymes however in this case nr was the best at stimulating sirtuinlike activities followed by niacin followed by nicotinamide the information from the mouse study subsequently helped brenners team design the formal clinical trial in addition to showing that nr boosts nad in humans without adverse effects the trial confirmed that naad is a highly sensitive biomarker of nr supplementation in people now that we have demonstrated safety in this small clinical trial we are in a position to find out if the health benefits that we have seen in animals can be reproduced in people says brenner who also is codirector of the obesity research and education initiative professor of internal medicine and a member of the fraternal order of eagles diabetes research center at the ui

fake,scientists at newcastle university believe a drug commonly prescribed for type 2 diabetes could be routinely taken by type 1 diabetic patients to slow the development or delay heart disease metformin is an inexpensive treatment that is often used for type 2 diabetes to lower blood sugar levels by reducing glucose production in the liver the drug is not regularly given to patients with type 1 diabetes however for the first time a clinical trial has revealed metformin can promote a patients ability to repair their own damaged blood vessels by increasing vascular stem cells heart disease is the leading cause of illness in diabetic patients accounting for more than half of all fatalities metformin may be used to lower type 1 diabetic patients risk of developing this complication findings of the clinical trial are published today in the journal cardiovascular diabetology this follows previous laboratory work at newcastle university which explored the mechanism behind metformin dr jolanta weaver senior lecturer in diabetes medicine at newcastle university and honorary consultant diabetologist at queen elizabeth hospital gateshead led both studies she believes this new research is a major development in understanding the best ways to further improve treatment in type 1 diabetes dr weaver said as the outcomes of heart disease is worse in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients there is a need to identify additional treatment options metformin could routinely be used by patients with type 1 diabetes to help lower their chances of developing heart disease by increasing a repair mechanism created by vascular stem cells released from the bone marrow our research is an exciting step forward as it may have positive clinical implications for patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease by improving their treatment options for the first time this study has shown metformin has additional benefit beyond improving diabetes control when given to patients with relatively well controlled type 1 diabetes we have established the drug increases patients own vascular stem cells which will help delay or slowdown heart disease our findings also show that the cells associated with damaged blood vessels were reduced confirming that the repair of blood vessels was taking place in our patients researchers studied a treatment group of 23 people aged 1964 who had type 1 diabetes for up to 23 years and had no evidence of heart disease patients were given metformin at a dose they could tolerate between one to three tablets a day for eight weeks participants were advised to adjust their insulin to keep blood glucose levels safe scientists measured patients stem cells directly in the blood and also grew stem cells in a test tube observing how they behaved another cell type was also counted to assess damaged blood vessels the participants were matched with nine patients within the same age bracket who took standard insulin treatment and 23 healthy nondiabetic people aged 2064 experts found that the stem cells of patients who took metformin were able to promote the repair of the blood vessels and there was an improvement in how vascular stem cells worked type 1 diabetes is a lifelong autoimmune condition that develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin causing a persons blood sugar level to become too high it is estimated around 400000 people in the uk have the condition dr weaver said we have shown that all our patients in the study had their insulin doses reduced after taking metformin and have not suffered any serious adverse effect patients with type 1 diabetes may wish to consider discussing with their gp the possibility of adding metformin even at a very low dose to the insulin that they are taking however care needs to be taken to adjust insulin dose to prevent too low glucose levels a pilot study was funded by diabetes research and wellness foundation and the extended study was financially supported by the diabetes research fund in gateshead dr eleanor kennedy research manager at diabetes research and wellness foundation said the diabetes research and wellness foundation is delighted to have funded the initial pilot study that led dr weaver and her colleagues to conduct this small clinical trial the results which indicate that metformin a drug commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes could also have a powerful effect in people with type 1 diabetes is unexpected we hope that these results can lead to a much larger clinical trial case study quantity surveyor alex laws was part of the newcastle university clinical trial and is delighted with the results of the study the 31yearold of gateshead was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of just seven and has good control of her condition she was enrolled on the clinical trial in the summer of 2013 alex said i was keen to be part of the clinical trial as i know how important research is into helping people with the condition i previously worked in the medical research field people with type 1 diabetes can suffer from a number of complications especially in the longterm so its

fake,newswise eating a mediterranean diet can slow down cognitive decline the mediterranean diet can improve your mind as well your heart shows a study published in the openaccess journal frontiers in nutrition by sticking to the mediterranean diet the study showed that people had slowed rates of cognitive decline reduced conversion to alzheimers and improved cognitive function the main foods in the mediterranean diet meddiet include plant foods such as leafy greens fresh fruit and vegetables cereals beans seeds nuts and legumes the meddiet is also low in dairy has minimal red meat and uses olive oil as its major source of fat leading author roy hardman from the centre for human psychopharmacology swinburne university of technology melbourne australia and his colleagues evaluated all the available papers between 20002015 that investigated if and how a meddiet may impact cognitive processes over time in total 18 out of the 135 articles met their strict inclusion criteria the most surprising result was that the positive effects were found in countries around the whole world so regardless of being located outside of what is considered the mediterranean region the positive cognitive effects of a higher adherence to a meddiet were similar in all evaluated papers he said attention memory and language improved memory in particular was positively affected by the meddiet including improvements in delayed recognition longterm and working memory executive function and visual constructs why is a higher adherence to the meddiet related to slowing down the rate of cognitive decline the meddiet offers the opportunity to change some of the modifiable risk factors he explained these include reducing inflammatory responses increasing micronutrients improving vitamin and mineral imbalances changing lipid profiles by using olive oils as the main source of dietary fats maintaining weight and potentially reducing obesity improving polyphenols in the blood improving cellular energy metabolism and maybe changing the gut microbiota although this has not been examined to a larger extent yet moreover the benefits to cognition afforded by the meddiet were not exclusive to older individuals two of the included studies focused on younger adults and they both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments the researchers stress that research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 2030 years they envision that the utilization of a dietary pattern such as the meddiet will be an essential tool to maintain quality of life and reduce the potential social and economic burdens of manifested cognitive declines like dementia i would therefore recommend people to try to adhere or switch to a meddiet even at an older age hardman added like many researchers hardman takes his research home i follow the diet patterns and do not eat any red meats chicken or pork i have fish twothree times per week and adhere to a mediterranean style of eating see original study want a better memory try eating a mediterranean diet
fake,this new drug could be a game changer for future treatment of asthma professor chris brightling nihr senior research fellow at the university of leicester the first new asthma pill for nearly 20 years has the power to significantly reduce the severity of the condition a study led by the university of leicester has found the research was funded by novartis pharmaceuticals national institute for health research nihr and the eu airprom and is described by the lead researcher as a game changer for future treatment of asthma three people die every day because of asthma attacks and research shows that two thirds of asthma deaths are preventable according to asthma uk fevipiprant qaw039 significantly decreased the symptoms of asthma improved lung function reduced inflammation and repaired the lining of airways the drug is currently being evaluated in late stage clinical trials for efficacy in patients with severe asthma according to clintrialsgov a total of 61 people took part in the research one group was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks and the other participants were assigned to a placebo group fevipiprant and the placebo were added to the medications the participants were already taking the study was designed primarily to examine the effects on inflammation in the airway by measuring the sputum eosinophil count the sputum eosinophil is an inflammation measurement of a white blood cell that increases in asthma and is used to assess the severity of this condition people who do not have asthma have a percentage of less than one and those with moderatetosevere asthma typically have a reading of about five per cent the rate in people with moderatetosevere asthma taking the medication was reduced from an average of 54 percent to 11 percent over 12 weeks according to the study published today in the prestigious the lancet respiratory medicine journal professor christopher brightling who is a nihr senior research fellow and clinical professor in respiratory medicine at the university of leicester led the study at the nihr respiratory biomedical research unit which is based at the glenfield hospital in leicester professor brightling said a unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms lung function using breathing tests sampling of the airway wall and ct scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works most treatments might improve some of these features of disease but with fevipiprant improvements were seen with all of the types of tests we already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks this new treatment fevipiprant could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks reduce hospital admissions and improve daytoday symptoms making it a game changer for future treatment gaye stokes from grantham in lincolnshire has had severe asthma for 16 years she took part in the trial and was part of the fevipiprant group the 54yearold said i knew straight away that i had been given the drug i felt like a completely different person i had more get up and go i was less wheezy and for the first time in years i felt really really well for me it felt like a complete wonder drug and i cant wait for it to be available because i really think it could make a huge difference to me after the 12 week trial and gaye stopped receiving the drug she said her health started to go downhill again very quickly professor brightling added that the latest advance underpinned the work of the leicester precision medicine institute a centre of excellence that coalesces and aligns the research missions of the university of leicester and the nhs in leicester future treatment of human disease will increasingly move from a one size fits all approach to one of tailoring the treatment to the individual patient asthma is a longterm condition that affects the airways when a person with asthma comes into contact with something that irritates their sensitive airways it causes the body to react in several ways which can include wheezing coughing and can make breathing more difficult the nihr leicester respiratory biomedical research unit a partnership between the university of leicester and leicesters hospitals focuses on promoting the development of new and effective therapies for the treatment of respiratory diseases including severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd airprom stands for airway disease predicting outcomes through patient specific computational modelling this is the technical name for the five year europewide eu funded project which aimed to produce computer and physical models of the whole human airway system for people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd airprom has demonstrated how an integrated approach involving modelling measurement and clinical validation can accelerate the development of new therapies and improve existing methods airprom is led by the university of leicester and coordinated by professor brightling

fake,newswise for three years andrew harder wondered if he had prostate cancer in 2009 he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostatespecific antigen psa level when psa is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor harders psa was 9 by the time harder saw a urologist it had skyrocketed to 20 his doctor recommended the traditional next step a transrectal ultrasound trus biopsy which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate over the course of two years harder 60 an mri technologist would have three trus biopsies they were all inconclusive it is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising psa and no proof of cancer harder said after harders third biopsy his urologist was ready to throw in the towel and thats when harder was referred to jinxing yu md at vcu health by then harders psa was around 30 yu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the department of radiology at vcu over the past five years he has developed diagnostic techniques using mri technology to investigate difficult cases like harders after one mri yu found harders tumor after that yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the mri scanner allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor harder finally had a diagnosis in 2012 he started on a treatment plan hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate and then external beam radiation to finish the job today his psa is normal other patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from trus biopsies yet persistently high psa levels may not be as fortunate a patient had 10 trus biopsies and his doctors still couldnt find a tumor yu said if you do not have this kind of advanced imaging sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor cant be found and treated because its too late it has already metastasized he ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later precise imaging leads to detection magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis when caught early prostate cancer is highly treatable much like someone would have an mri to investigate the cause of back pain the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue vcu medical center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric mri which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate each of the sequences t2 weighted imaging diffusionweighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging tells a story and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy interpreting a prostate mri to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences if we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy said sarah winks md an attending physician in the department of radiology an mri can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is yu said and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment traditional meets emerging technology in addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonanceultrasound fusion biopsy mri scans are overlaid with realtime ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor in 2014 vcu healths department of radiology supported by the division of urology in the department of surgery purchased ultrasoundmri fusion biopsy equipment prior to this yus team had performed targeted mri biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the mri scanner as the needle was guided to the target area a sort of stopmotion procedure that could take up to an hour the new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes a study published in 2015 by the center for cancer research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing highrisk aggressive cancers than a trus biopsy it is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate near where harders tumor was located yu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametricmri read the mri scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate at most places there will be a radiologist reading the mr image and a clinician performing the biopsy the person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different yu said sometimes you dont get the same result we do both thats one of our strengths new path to diagnosis yu has seen how mri technology has changed prostate patients care five years ago 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high psa would never get any imaging yu said right now i think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging sometimes these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of yus patients did last year last august jim grandon of colville washington discovered he had a psa of 53 it was elevated from the 41 measurement that he had registered for a few years the rising psa was cause for concern instead of going through with an immediate trus biopsy recommended by his urologist he decided to research next steps with just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate grandon said i found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent when i went back to my urologist he said why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here i said because 85 percent is better than 40 percent vcu medical center was one of the places grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done and a few phone calls later he was on a plane flying across the country to see yu on his second day in richmond grandon had an mri that showed a lesion the next day yu biopsied it on the fourth day grandon flew home and began researching treatment options he opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home and recently completed his treatment a change in care more and more physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of mri technology for prostate care which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment according to the center for cancer research study mri targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer lowrisk tumors these are tumors that would have never developed into a lifethreatening cancer but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily when yu started prostate mri screening in 2011 his team performed about 50 scans per year now with the support of massey cancer center urology and radiation oncology they are doing about 1200 multiparametricmri and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year he estimates the volume will continue to increase because vcu will attract patients not only from the greater richmond area but also patients such as grandon from other parts of the country yu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care he speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram men would have a baseline prostate mri and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history increasing the odds of prostate cancer detection

fake,florence italy 9 july 2016 immunotherapy reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis according to research presented today at frontiers in cardiovascular biology fcvb 2016 by professor aida babaeva head of the department of internal medicine volgograd state medical university volgograd russia1 the combination of two extralow dose anticytokine drugs reduced rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor tnf and interferon ifn which normally protect the body attack healthy cells said professor babaeva patients have painful and inflamed joints they are also at increased cardiovascular risk particularly if their rheumatoid arthritis is not controlled professor babaevas previous research showed that treatment with anticytokine drugs can decrease the activity of rheumatoid arthritis extralow dose antitnf reduced levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines including creactive protein crp rheumatoid factor tnf interleukin1 il1 and interleukin6 il6 the effect was more apparent and developed earlier when patients were treated with a combination of antitnf and antiifn both at extralow doses the current study investigated the impact of the combination of drugs on cardiovascular events it included 68 patients who had suffered from active rheumatoid arthritis for at least five years patients were randomised to receive the combination of antitnf and antiifn plus standard diseasemodifying therapy 38 patients or placebo plus standard therapy 30 patients during the three year follow up period the investigators monitored rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events patients taking the combination of anticytokines had a lower rheumatoid arthritis disease activity score as measured by the das282 and more dramatic decreases in il1 il6 and tnf than the group on standard therapy alone the incidence of cardiovascular events unstable angina severe hypertensive crisis and deterioration of chronic heart failure was more than double in the group on conventional diseasemodifying drugs alone 37 compared to those also taking the combination of anticytokines 13 professor babaeva said our findings suggest that the decreased rheumatoid arthritis disease activity with the combination of anticytokines translates into decreased cardiovascular risk rheumatoid arthritis promotes the development of cardiovascular disease in a number of ways therefore decreasing disease activity may also reduce cardiovascular risk by slowing down or halting these processes for example rheumatoid arthritis is associated with dysfunction of the blood vessel lining called endothelium which leads to lipid accumulation in the artery wall plaque formation and atherosclerosis increased disease activity is also linked with a procoagulant state in which patients are more prone to blood clots and thrombosis patients with active disease have an increase in molecules that promote inflammation which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension target blood pressure was reached in 71 of those taking the combination of anticytokines compared to just 32 of patients on standard therapy alone professor babaeva said this doesnt mean that the two drugs directly impact on blood pressure but the combination can improve endothelial function and it could be that blood pressure is more stable when disease activity is low we found that the combination of two anticytokines containing extralow doses of antibodies against tnf and ifn can improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk said professor babaeva she concluded we do not think that all patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with this combination in patients with highly active disease the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction andor systemic manifestations vasculitis uveitis involvement of internal organs we recommend this new approach for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with moderate disease activity who are not receiving the standard biologics and who do not have severe complications

fake,key points question does treatment with cetuximab and radiotherapy crt increase the rate of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomyfree survival compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma findings in this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial comparing crt vs radiotherapy alone in 168 treated patients there was no difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 years there was a 40 and 89 absolute improvement in laryngectomyfree survival at 2 and 3 years respectively for crt vs radiotherapy alone meaning the results of this secondary subset analysis reveal a possible cetuximabrelated benefit in laryngeal preservation abstract importance the appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapybased approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate unfortunately there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in the last 30 years objective to assess the rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomyfree survival in patients receiving cetuximab and radiotherapy crt and patients receiving radiotherapy alone design setting and participants patients were enrolled in a multicenter openlabel stratified randomized phase 3 study from april 1 1999 through march 31 2002 from 73 centers in the united states and 14 other countries a secondary subgroup analysis of patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma was undertaken rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomyfree survival were estimated by the kaplanmeier method the hazard ratios hrs were calculated using a cox proportional hazards regression model quality of life was evaluated using the european organization for research and treatment of cancer core questionnaire and head and neck module main outcomes and measures laryngeal preservation and laryngectomyfree survival results of the 424 patients included in the trial 168 treated patients with cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx were included in this analysis 90 in the crt group and 78 in the radiotherapy alone group the median range age of the patients was 59 4080 years in the crt group and 61 3581 years in the radiotherapy alone group in the crt group 72 patients 800 were male and 18 200 were female in the radiotherapy alone group 62 795 were male and 16 205 were female the rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 years were 879 for crt vs 857 for radiotherapy alone with an hr of 057 95 ci 023142 p 22 similarly the hr for laryngectomyfree survival comparing crt vs radiotherapy alone was 078 95 ci 054111 p 17 this study was not powered to assess organ preservation median overall survival was 27 95 ci 2045 vs 21 95 ci 1735 months for the crt and radiotherapy alone groups respectively with an hr of 087 95 ci 060127 no differences between treatments were reported regarding overall quality of life need for a feeding tube or speech conclusions and relevance the results of a possible cetuximabrelated laryngeal preservation benefit for patients with hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer are intriguing these results need to be interpreted in the context of a retrospective subset analysis with limited sample size trial registration clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct00004227 introduction historically locoregionally advanced squamous cell cancers of the larynx or hypopharynx have been treated with surgical resection usually involving laryngectomy with or without postoperative radiotherapy1 although laryngectomy is an effective treatment investigators have sought therapeutic strategies that result in voice preservation various modifications of surgical techniques have been explored25 alternatively in the early 1980s investigators evaluated curative primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery as an option for these patients67 retrospective studies89 that compared primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery to initial surgery with postoperative radiotherapy found similar rates of survival in patients with advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers after the realization that many patients could avoid total laryngectomy with the use of primary radiotherapy several combination chemoradiotherapy strategies were introduced for patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers in large phase 3 randomized clinical trials induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy demonstrated equivalent overall survival compared with surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal1011 and hypopharyngeal cancers12 more recently the radiation therapy oncology group 9111 trial revealed that radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin resulted in a superior laryngeal preservation rate compared with induction with cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for these advanced laryngeal cancers1314 however this treatment did not produce a survival benefit the appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapybased approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate1518 unfortunately there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in large database studies1921 examining the last 30 years of care investigators have reported that poor followup may contribute to the potential for larger and less curable recurrences and surgeons experienced with radiotherapy with salvage surgery need to be involved as early as possible2021 the analysis described in this report was performed to assess the laryngeal preservation rates of patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers who were entered into a randomized clinical trial of cetuximab and radiotherapy crt compared with radiotherapy alone2223 this group of patients represents a subgroup 168 patients of a larger population 424 patients that also included patients with oropharyngeal cancers it is noteworthy that this randomized clinical trial was not designed to enroll a sufficient number of patients to definitively and prospectively address the subject of the analysis reported herein previous reports2223 of the overall randomized clinical trial found locoregional control and survival advantages associated with the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy methods patients patients were enrolled in the multicenter openlabel stratified randomized phase 3 study from april 1 1999 through march 31 2002 from 73 centers in the united states and 14 other countries patients who entered the trial had stage iii or iv nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx hypopharynx or larynx figure 1 and table 1 patients were eligible if they had pathologically confirmed stage iii or iv squamous cell carcinoma had measurable disease had no distant metastases had no prior therapy for the tumor under study and were medically suitable to undergo definitive radiotherapy this subgroup includes the patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers the protocol was approved by the ethics review boards at the participating institutions and all the patients provided written informed consent patients were initially evaluated with a comprehensive head and neck examination which included panendoscopy the primary tumors and lymph nodes were staged by the american joint committee on cancer staging classification of 1998 initial evaluation included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region and chest radiography patients began treatment within 2 weeks after this initial evaluation as determined by the randomization procedure22 patients who underwent no surgery or less extensive operations were censored at death or date of last contact treatment the primary radiotherapy was delivered with curative intent investigators selected 1 of 3 radiation fractionation regimens once daily twice daily or concomitant boost regimen figure 1 cervical lymph node drainage regions considered to be at high risk for subclinical disease were treated with a dose of 50 to 54 gy the primary tumor and gross nodal disease received fulldose radiotherapy 70768 gy depending on fractionation however if a postoperative neck dissection was planned gross nodal disease could be treated with 60 gy for patients randomized to crt cetuximab treatment consisted of an initial dose of 400 mgm2 and was delivered as a 120minute intravenous infusion this initial dose was delivered 1 week before the initiation of crt patients received weekly cetuximab infusions during the radiotherapy treatment seven weekly infusions were delivered at a dose of 250 mgm2 for a period of 60 minutes each for patients who were scheduled to have a planned neck dissection surgery was scheduled to take place 4 to 8 weeks after completion of crt or radiotherapy alone evaluations evaluations including physical examination hematologic testing and chemical profiles were performed weekly for the duration of the study a pharmacologic profile was also performed weekly on patients receiving cetuximab infusion crt group patients provided a history and underwent a physical examination which included a fiberoptic examination of the tumor as well as an assessment of all study end points at required time points after the completion of treatment22 posttreatment assessments were performed 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy patients who were scheduled for a planned postoperative neck dissection could have their 8week assessment at the 6week time point along with posttreatment computed tomography subsequently patients were evaluated every 4 months during the first and second years they were evaluated semiannually during years 3 to 5 these followup assessments included imaging studies consisting of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region quality of life the instruments used in this study were the european organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire core 30 version 30 and the quality of life head and neck module 35 the selfadministered core questionnaire consisted of 30 questions and incorporated 5 functional scales 3 symptom scales and a global health and qualityoflife scale the remaining single items assessed additional symptoms commonly reported by patients with cancer as well as the perceived financial effect of disease and treatment all scales and single items met the standards for reliability the 35item module comprised 1 multiitem scale and a series of single items assessing head and neckassociated symptoms and adverse effects from conventional therapy statistical analysis the randomization was not stratified by primary site of cancer hence the results presented below are a retrospective analysis of the selected subset of patients a consort flow diagram was included with the original publication of the trial23 a trial profile for the analysis presented here is shown in figure 1 the primary end point of the study was to examine differences in the rate of locoregional disease control maintained for 1 year the duration of locoregional control was defined as the absence of locoregional disease progression at the scheduled followup visits and was determined through a masked review of the investigatorgenerated data by an independent committee of experts the duration of locoregional control was from randomization to the first documented progression or recurrence of locoregional disease or death from any cause overall survival was calculated from randomization to death from any cause tumor present in a neck dissection which was performed for any reason after 15 weeks after radiotherapy constituted locoregional progression distribution of timetoevent parameters was estimated by the kaplanmeier method and treatment effects were compared using a logrank test the cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the nonstratified hazard ratio hr the kaplanmeier method was also used to estimate the rate of preservation of larynx24 patients who underwent no surgery or lesser operations were censored at death or date of last contact results characteristics of the patients a total of 424 patients participated in the study and 168 were included in the subanalysis 90 in the crt group or 78 in the radiotherapy alone group most patients from both treatment groups were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation regimen the 2 treatment groups were well balanced with respect to sex tumor stage node stage table 1 and the rate of neck surgery 16 in the crt group and 14 in the radiotherapy alone group treatment adherence the median durations of treatment were 52 46 and 43 days for once daily twice daily or concomitant boost respectively for patients treated with crt and 52 44 and 43 days respectively for patients treated with radiotherapy alone for patients who received cetuximab the median number of cetuximab infusions was 8 range 111 the median cumulative cetuximab dose was 2154 mgm2 range 142887 mgm2 the number of patients who received 7 or more cetuximab infusions was 80 889 the radiotherapy quality assurance review found that the mean and median doses for the once daily twice daily and concomitant boost regimens were 687 and 700 gy 743 and 744 gy and 708 and 720 gy respectively these doses were similar in both treatment groups radiotherapy adherence for patients who received crt or radiotherapy alone was balanced 65 722 received crt and 56 718 received radiotherapy alone as planned or with minor deviation a total of 121 patients 72 were treated as planned or with minor deviation major acceptable deviations in the crt and radiotherapy alone groups were found in 13 144 and 13 167 patients and major unacceptable deviations were observed in 3 33 and 5 64 patients respectively a total of 9 100 and 4 51 patients in these respective groups were not evaluable for a radiation quality assurance review the differences in radiotherapy adherence between the 2 treatment groups were not statistically significant neck dissections were performed in 14 patients 156 treated with crt and 11 patients 141 treated with radiotherapy alone efficacy locoregional control was the primary end point of the phase 3 study for this subgroup of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers locoregional control was slightly improved for patients who received crt compared with radiotherapy alone hr 080 95 ci 056113 table 2 the 2year rates of locoregional control were 369 in the crt group and 257 in the radiotherapy alone group survival was also slightly improved for patients who received crt compared with radiotherapy alone hr 087 95 ci 060127 table 2 the 3year survival rates were 419 in the crt group and 390 in the radiotherapy alone group the rates of laryngeal preservation no need for salvage laryngectomy were 879 at 2 and 3 years in the crt group compared with 857 at 2 years and 768 at 3 years in the radiotherapy alone group the 22 and 111 absolute improvements in the rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 and 3 years respectively favored crt compared with radiotherapy alone figure 2 however this improvement was not statistically significant hr 057 95 ci 023142 p 22 in addition there was a 40 and 89 absolute improvement in laryngectomyfree survival at 2 and 3 years respectively again these differences did not reach statistical significance hr 078 95 ci 054111 p 17 figure 2 safety the most frequently reported adverse events are given in table 3 the frequency of grades 3 and 4 mucositisstomatitis and odynophagia was not significantly different among patients who received crt compared with radiotherapy alone patients who received crt had a greater rate of acneiform rash compared with patients who received radiotherapy alone table 3 chills fever and headache were the only toxic events reported to occur at any grade with significantly higher frequency p 002 p 01 and p 004 respectively in patients in the crt group than in the radiotherapy alone group however their incidences were low chills 16 178 vs 2 26 fever 20 222 vs 6 77 headache 20 222 vs 5 64 quality of life the qualityoflife responses were evaluated in a longitudinal design in all patients baseline assessment was performed at or just after randomization subsequent assessments took place before the beginning of the fourth week of radiotherapy at the 8week posttreatment evaluation and at the 2 every4month followup evaluations of year 1 plots of mean changes in global health status use of a feeding tube or speech problems reveal no differences between the treatment groups figure 3 a positive value in change indicates an improvement for the patient differences in mean changes in swallowing at radiotherapy week 4 15 in the crt group and 25 in the radiotherapy alone group p 02 loss of appetite at

radiotherapy week 4 74 in the crt group and 56 in the radiotherapy alone group p 02 and at week 8 after radiotherapy 32 in the crt group and 11 in the radiotherapy alone group p 04 constipation at month 8 26 in the crt group and 19 in the radiotherapy alone group p < 001 and cognitive functioning at month 12 70 in the crt group and 46 in the radiotherapy alone group p 04 were not seen at the other time points discussion when laryngectomy is the primary treatment for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers patients gradually adjust to the loss of natural phonation but the condition substantially interferes with normal communication and social interactions25 in addition although the effect of the procedure on voice frequently receives the greatest consideration the presence of the stoma may also adversely affect patients quality of life26 in the analysis reported herein laryngeal preservation rates were studied in a subgroup of patients who were part of a large phase 3 trial that compared primary radiotherapy with or without the antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab the use of crt produced a higher rate of laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone for patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers although the difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation between the 2 groups did not reach statistical significance the initial trial was not powered to assess this subgroup question the hr of 057 is a strong indicator that cetuximab when added to radiotherapy may improve laryngeal preservation the 879 rate of laryngeal preservation at 2 years for crt found in this trial is similar to the rate reported for the use of radiotherapy and concomitant cisplatin in radiation therapy oncology group 9111 trial n 54713 patients who undergo a laryngectomy often experience a difficult adjustment process even when the patient achieves a certain level of comfort with various techniques of artificial speech27 the ability to communicate with others is hampered262829 investigations have explored both the patients and the interviewers perceptions of the patients difficulty with communication after laryngectomy26 of interest the interviewers perceived the patients impairment with communication as a much greater infringement on quality of life compared with the patients perceptions patients who underwent laryngectomy believed that interference with social activities resulted in a greater detrimental effect regarding their quality of life compared with the interviewers perception of this factor therefore patients have their own perceptions as well as the perceptions of others as potential hurdles to normal activities after laryngectomy the perception of life without a larynx plays an important role in a patients treatment decision in a recent trial from france 269 patients were queried about the treatment choices they might make if they faced the diagnosis of advanced laryngeal cancer30 only 29 stated that they would not consider options with a lower chance of cure if told that the best option with respect to survival was total laryngectomy however their enthusiasm for seeking laryngealpreserving options waned when told about potential adverse effects such as tracheostomy or permanent gastrostomy an older report31 of interviews with firefighters and executives who were asked to envision that they had advanced laryngeal cancer determined that they were willing to accept a 15 to 30 reduction in life expectancy for a laryngealpreserving treatment compared with total laryngectomy these studies3031 demonstrate the importance of reviewing options and potential adverse effects with patients before making a decision regarding the best treatment considering the importance of laryngeal function many head and neck cancer treatments have been directed toward the goal of laryngeal preservation one of the largest randomized clinical trials was designed to evaluate laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone concomitant chemoradiotherapy and induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy1314 each treatment group included at least 180 patients thus providing much greater statistical power than the current communication the use of concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone with a hazard ratio of 046 however the induction regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil did not improve laryngeal preservation over radiotherapy alone neither concomitant chemoradiotherapy nor induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone furthermore there were greater severe acute toxic effects from the chemoradiotherapy treatments compared with radiotherapy alone13 but no significant differences in severe late toxic effects were noted in the comparison of the 3 treatment arms14 unfortunately the concomitant chemoradiotherapy arm had an increase in deaths not attributable to cancer compared with the other 2 arms this finding needs to be explored further to determine whether undetected fatal late treatment toxic effects are greater with concomitant regimens although induction chemotherapy was not used in this trial it has been the subject of many past and recent assessments involving laryngeal preservation as well as other efficacy and safety outcomes1014 a retrospective review32 of the phase 3 tax 324 trial induction chemotherapy comparing taxotere cisplatin and 5fluorouracil with standard cisplatin and 5fluorouracil followed by chemoradiation in locally advanced head and neck cancer in patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers revealed that induction chemotherapy of docetaxel cisplatin and fluorouracil n 90 compared with cisplatin plus fluorouracil n 76 followed by chemoradiotherapy with weekly carboplatin resulted in significantly improved overall survival p 02 and progressionfree survival p 03 for the docetaxel cisplatin and fluorouracil group among patients undergoing surgery laryngectomyfree survival was also significantly greater with docetaxel cisplatin and fluorouracil p 03 the tremplin radiotherapy with cisplatin versus radiotherapy with cetuximab after induction chemotherapy for larynx preservation trial compared the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy using docetaxel cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin n 60 or cetuximab n 56 for laryngeal preservation33 no differences were found in laryngeal preservation laryngeal function preservation or overall survival between the 2 regimens newer studies such as decide docetaxelbased chemotherapy plus or minus ic to decrease events in head and neck cancer34 and paradigm combination chemotherapy and radiation in treating patients with stage iii or iv head and neck cancer35 suggest no overall benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy vs concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone conclusions the higher rate of laryngeal preservation that was achieved with the use of crt compared with radiotherapy alone was encouraging furthermore no significant increases in the most debilitating radiotherapyinduced toxic effects such as mucositisstomatitis and dysphagia were observed this treatment approach warrants further evaluation in larger populations to fully assess the potential value of cetuximab or other molecular targeting

and whose pet scan showed reduced glucose utilization indicative of ad an mri showed hippocampal volume at only the 17th percentile for his age after 10 months on the protocol a followup mri showed a dramatic increase of his hippocampal volume to the 75th percentile with an associated absolute increase in volume of nearly 12 percent in another instance a 69year old professional man and entrepreneur who was in the process of shutting down his business went on the protocol after 11 years of progressive memory loss after six months his wife coworkers and he noted improvement in memory a lifelong ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head returned and he reported an ability to remember his schedule and recognize faces at work after 22 months on the protocol he returned for followup quantitative neuropsychological testing results showed marked improvements in all categories with his longterm recall increasing from the 3rd to 84th percentile he is expanding his business another patient a 49year old woman who noted progressive difficulty with word finding and facial recognition went on the protocol after undergoing quantitative neuropsychological testing at a major university she had been told she was in the early stages of cognitive decline and was therefore ineligible for an alzheimers prevention program after several months on the protocol she noted a clear improvement in recall reading navigating vocabulary mental clarity and facial recognition her foreign language ability had returned nine months after beginning the program she did a repeat of the neuropsychological testing at the same university site she no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline all but one of the ten patients included in the study are at genetic risk for ad carrying at least one copy of the apoe4 allele five of the patients carry two copies of apoe4 which gives them a 1012 fold increased risk of developing ad were entering a new era said bredesen the old advice was to avoid testing for apoe because there was nothing that could be done about it now were recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention sixtyfive percent of the alzheimers cases in this country involve apoe4 with seven million people carrying two copies of the apoe4 allele bredesen s systemsbased approach to reverse memory loss follows the abject failure of monotherapies designed to treat ad and the success of combination therapies to treat other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease cancer and hiv bredesen says decades of biomedical research both in his and other labs has revealed that an extensive network of molecular interactions is involved in ad pathogenesis suggesting that a broaderbased therapeutic approach may be more effective imagine having a roof with 36 holes in it and your drug patched one hole very wellthe drug may have worked a single hole may have been fixed but you still have 35 other leaks and so the underlying process may not be affected much bredesen said we think addressing multiple targets within the molecular network may be additive or even synergistic and that such a combinatorial approach may enhance drug candidate performance as well while encouraged by the results of the study bredesen admits more needs to be done the magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective bredesen said even though we see the farreaching implications of this success we also realize that this is a very small study that needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites plans for larger studies are underway cognitive decline is often listed as the major concern of older adults already alzheimers disease affects approximately 54 million americans and 30 million people globally without effective prevention and treatment the prospects for the future are bleak by 2050 its estimated that 160 million people globally will have the disease including 13 million americans leading to potential bankruptcy of the medicare system unlike several other chronic illnesses alzheimers disease is on the riserecent estimates suggest that ad has become the third leading cause of death in the united states behind cardiovascular disease and cancer the

fake,australian researchers have discovered that an existing medication could have promise in preventing breast cancer in women carrying a faulty brca1 gene people who carry a faulty brca1 gene are at high risk of developing aggressive breast cancer currently many women with a gene mutation choose surgical removal of their breast tissue and ovaries to reduce their chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer by pinpointing the cells that give rise to breast cancers in women who have inherited a faulty version of the brca1 gene walter and eliza hall institute researchers have identified that the drug denosumab may have potential to prevent breast cancer from developing if confirmed in clinical studies this would provide a nonsurgical option to prevent breast cancer in women with elevated genetic risk using samples of breast tissue donated by women carrying a faulty brca1 gene ms emma nolan professor jane visvader and professor geoff lindeman were able to pinpoint the cells that give rise to breast cancer the research which also involved researchers at the australian familial cancer consortium kconfab and us biotechnology company amgen was published today in nature medicine cancer precursor cells in brca1mutant breast tissue had many similarities to aggressive forms of breast cancer said ms nolan who is a phd student at the institute enrolled through the university of melbournes department of medical biology these cells proliferated rapidly and were susceptible to damage to their dna both factors that help them transition towards cancer she said we were excited to discover that these precancerous cells could be identified by a marker protein called rank professor lindeman who is also a medical oncologist at the royal melbourne hospital said the discovery of rank as a marker of cancer precursors was an important breakthrough because inhibitors of the rank signalling pathway were already in clinical use an inhibitor called denosumab is already used in the clinic to treat osteoporosis and breast cancer that has spread to the bone he said we therefore investigated what effect rank inhibition had on the cancer precursor cells in brca1mutant breast tissue the research team showed that rank inhibition switched off cell growth in breast tissue from women with a faulty brca1 gene and curtailed breast cancer development in laboratory models we think this strategy could delay or prevent breast cancer in women with an inherited brca1 gene mutation professor lindeman said a clinical trial has already begun to investigate this further this is potentially a very important discovery for women who carry a faulty brca1 gene who have few other options current cancer prevention strategies for these women include surgical removal of the breasts andor ovaries which can have serious impacts on peoples lives to progress this work denosumab would need to be formally tested in clinical trials in this setting as it is not approved for breast cancer prevention professor lindeman said professor visvader said the discovery had its basis in more than a decade of investigations of breast stem cell function by thoroughly dissecting how normal breast tissue develops we have been able to pinpoint the precise cells that are the culprits in cancer formation she said it is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the holy grail of cancer research devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk the research team worked closely with mrs avis macphee a patient advocate through the walter and eliza hall institutes consumerresearcher buddy system the research was supported by the national breast cancer foundation the qualtrough cancer research fund the joan marshall breast cancer research fund the australian cancer research foundation cancer council victoria the cancer therapeutics cooperative research centre an amgen preclinical research program grant the national health and medical research council the victorian cancer agency and the victorian government operational infrastructure support scheme

fake,what nihsupported researchers are reporting additional details about a widelypublicized study that linked a systolic blood pressure target under 120 mm hg millimeters of mercury with reduced cardiovascular disease and a lower risk of death the new analysis singles out adults aged 75 and older and confirms that those with high blood pressure also benefit from the lower pressure target similar to the larger group studied in the earlier research nondiabetic adults aged 50 and older these additional results of the systolic blood pressure intervention trial sprint appear in the current online issue of the journal of the american medical association jama the study shows that for adults aged 75 years and older with high blood pressure a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm hg reduced rates of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and heart failure as well as stroke by 33 percent this lower blood pressure goal also reduced the risk of death among this group by 32 percent compared to a target systolic pressure of 140 mm hg the benefits of a more aggressive blood pressure intervention occurred in both frail individuals with several impairments or disorders and nonfrail older participants the researchers note about threefourths of the us population aged 75 and older live with hypertension a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease and death although the standard blood pressure treatment goal is 140 mm hg various medical panels have provided inconsistent guidance about what is the optimal blood pressure goal for the senior population one group has recommended a target blood pressure of 160 mm hg for persons aged 80 or older while another recommended a target of 150 mm hg for adults aged 60 or older other experts have supported keeping the standard treatment goal at 140 mm hg to address this issue the sprint study tapped more than 2600 volunteers aged 75 and older assigning half to a target blood pressure of less than 140 mm hg and half to target of less than 120 mm hg while study participants with the lower blood pressure goal appeared to have better cardiovascular outcomes overall the researchers caution all other hypertension patients to talk to their doctor to determine whether this lower goal is best for their individual care in addition to primary sponsorship by the nhlbi sprint is cosponsored by the nihs national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke and the national institute on aging who lawrence fine md chief of the clinical applications and prevention branch at nhlbi and a coauthor of the study is available to comment on the findings and implications of this research
fake,increased blood pressure and reduced robustness of circadian rhythms are frequently reported in elderly subjects the present study was aimed to investigate whether such changes can be reversed by daily melatonin ingestion the older we get the more likely our circadian rhythms are disrupted for example blood pressure bp not only tends to increase but as well become more irregular luckily as we show in our research melatonin helps to ameliorate both trends 63 senior respondents of a mean age of 80 were studied during 3 consecutive weeks first week control data were collected for 7 successive days over the next 2 weeks the seniors were administered a low dose of melatonin 15 mg each day by night at 1030 pm on the third week data were monitored again melatonin significantly reduced bp the hypotensive effect was dependent on time the maximum systolic bp lowering effect of melatonin falls between 300 and 800 in the morning the time of the highest risk of heart attacks and strokes nighttime and morning bp decreased more profoundly on average 835 mm hg for sbpdbp respectively moreover the higher the mean systolic bp was during the first week the more it dropped on the second week of melatonin administration melatonin also decreased the overall variability in bp melatonin ws effective in synchronizing disrupted circadian rhythms of bp heart rate and body temperature making these circadian rhythms smoother and less irregular none of these effects was found in 34 placebo treated seniors thus ruling out the possibility that rhythms could be improved just because of regular schedule and presence of medical personal who took measurements in conclusion melatonin can be of great value for aged people suffering from hypertension as an adjuvant substance complementing basic medication as it is able to stabilize circadian bp heart rate profiles and their phase relationships the improvement of circadian pacemaker functions may also provide a new strategy in the treatment of hypertension
fake,a key objective of medicationassisted treatment for opioid use disorder is to reduce or eliminate the use of illicit opioids the results from the present phase 2 study demonstrate that cam2038 blocks effectively the subjective effects of opioid challenges with hydromorphone including limiting drug liking this study provides clinical proof of concept that cam2038 will be an effective treatment for opioid use disorder said behshad sheldon president and ceo of braeburn pharmaceuticals the current opioid crisis demands innovation and cam2038s novel technology is now one step closer to providing physicians and patients with a different approach to treating this deadly chronic disease the primary endpoint was met for both cam2038 doses demonstrating blockade of the subjective effects of hydromorphone as measured by the drug liking visual analog scale furthermore cam2038 was well tolerated across the course of treatment the study results show that cam2038 provides rapid and extended blockade of opioid effects said fredrik tiberg president and ceo of camurus the results also confirm the dose selection in the current phase 3 program and the potential of cam2038 as a future treatment alternative for patients with opioid use disorder from initiation to longterm maintenance the current study demonstrated that weekly injections of cam2038 produced significant and robust opioid blockade a critical mechanism of efficacy for medications treating opioid dependence cam2038 has the potential to alter the current treatment paradigm for opioid dependence said sharon walsh phd professor of behavioral science and director of the center on drug and alcohol research university of kentucky because of its long acting properties cam2038 may decrease patient and physician burden improve access to treatment and obviate public health concerns about illicit diversion of buprenorphine we were pleased to be involved in the development of cam2038 and are hopeful that it will serve as another safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with opioid use disorder the ability of cam2038 to produce a longlasting and robust blockade of hydromorphoneinduced drug liking is especially encouraging said sandra d comer phd professor of neurobiology columbia university importantly the fact that cam2038 will be given in the clinic by health providers should address concerns about diversion of buprenorphine for illicit use we feel that this medication with its ease of administration and flexible dosing capabilities could significantly improve management of patients about

mammography exams reduce recall rates and increase invasive cancer detection in women with both dense and nondense breasts these key benefits of 3d mammography could lower the costs associated with needless followup exams and improve patient experience for women seeking a more accurate screening mammogram density is only identifiable on a mammogram or other imaging system and is a reflection of how much fibrous or glandular tissue is in the breast higher breast density may increase a womans chance of getting breast cancer make detection of cancer on conventional mammography more difficult and increase the chances that a woman will be recalled for additional imaging12 mammograms are categorized into four density groups almost entirely fat scattered fibroglandular densities heterogeneously dense and extremely dense the latter two groups are considered dense however the vast majority of women whose mammograms are considered dense have heterogeneously dense breast tissue density creates challenges for conventional mammography by obscuring the images which often results in additional visits and exams for women said edward evantash md board certified obgyn and medical director for hologic this new analysis confirms that genius 3d mammography exams reduce unnecessary followup exams in densebreasted women this has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings reduce patient stress and expenses and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients improvements in both recall rate reduction and invasive cancer detection were greatest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts with a 50 percent increase in invasive cancer detection and a simultaneous 14 percent reduction in recall rate women with heterogeneously dense breasts make up about 40 percent of the us screening population women ages 4074 approximately 25 million women in the us utilizing genius 3d mammography exams for breast cancer screening will reduce the need for subsequent unnecessary testing and decrease the number of unnecessary breast biopsies addressing concerns that were previously raised as limitations of conventional mammography while also reducing costs for health systems said pete valenti hologics division president breast and skeletal health solutions twentysix states have passed legislation requiring doctors to notify women if they have dense breasts and now these women who were previously confused about how to proceed with breast cancer screening can feel confident turning to 3d mammography exams to reduce their chances of stressful recalls and help find more invasive cancer this study brought together the principal investigators from the

fake,websites arent telling full story on tobacco product risks the evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources buffalo ny millions of people visit the websites of the mayo clinic american cancer society and the centers for disease control and prevention among others seeking authoritative health information but are they receiving it when it comes to learning about the differences in risk among certain types of nicotine products many government websites are actually misleading or underinforming the public according to two researchers who analyzed the content of numerous health websites this information quarantine in turn helps explain the woeful lack of public knowledge about relative risks violating basic consumer rights as well as the public health principles of individual rights and health literacy the researchers say writing in the international journal of drug policy lynn kozlowski of the university at buffalo and david sweanor of the university of ottawa point out that many websites omit information showing that products such as ecigarettes smokeless tobacco and snus are far less harmful than traditional cigarettes public health ethics always has a concern to avoid any net harm to population health explains kozlowski professor of community health and health behavior at ub and the papers lead author the fear has been that much safer tobacco and nicotine products like snus smokeless tobacco and vape will possibly cause a net loss to public health because more people will use these products and these products may lead to cigarette use this fear however is not based on actual evidence and cannot be used to suppress or otherwise keep the public uninformed of what is clearly known about the lower risks of these products adds kozlowski phd one of the worlds leading researchers on smoking behavior an information quarantine functions similarly to a medical quarantine think of your favorite zombie movie or television show in which the infected person is secluded from everyone else to protect the overall public in order to justify a quarantine there has to be clear evidence that the need to protect population health should overrule personal autonomy in the case of providing information on differential health risks of nicotine products the evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources kozlowski says kozlowski and sweanor reviewed several major health websites including the cdc mayo clinic american cancer society substance abuse and mental health services administration and the national cancer institute and found three types of examples of information on smokeless tobacco but notomodest efforts to inform consumers of the significantly lower risks compared to cigarettes for lifelong users the researchers write in fact they found that the mayo clinic perpetuated a misrepresentation discovered in 2003 erroneously informing visitors that smokeless tobacco was as dangerous as cigarettes the day after the article was released the mayo clinic removed the headline replacing it with the still misleading statement that smokeless tobacco was not a safe product people can only make as good a decision as the information available to them allows said sweanor an adjunct professor in the university of ottawas faculty of law who has spearheaded the development of worldleading tobacco control initiatives in canada since the early 1980s the public is dramatically misinformed about the relative risks of substitutable tobacco and nicotine products the risk differentials are huge but this is simply not known by a vast majority of those whose lives are at risk adds sweanor england has an example of a website action on smoking and health ash that gets it right on vaping the researchers said a briefing posted on the site specifically states compared to tobacco products electronic cigarettes are significantly safer in their paper the researchers note that information on comparative risks is common for other products and activities like overthecounter medicines and even safety ratings of vehicles they argue that the us food and drug administration fda which regulates the sale of tobacco products isnt doing its part to inform consumers of important differences in harm among tobacco products to illustrate their point kozlowski and sweanor use the example that if one type of alcoholic beverage caused 3 in 5 regular users to die prematurely as is the case with smoking traditional cigarettes while another caused massively fewer deaths consumers would want to know which product was the safer alternative it would be scandalous even criminal to keep such facts from consumers the researchers write yet such facts are being kept from adult consumers of legal

fake,dallas april 18 2016 a fiveyear study shows that stereotactic body radiation therapy sbrt to treat prostate cancer offers a higher cure rate than more traditional approaches according to researchers at ut southwestern medical center harold c simmons comprehensive cancer center the study the first trial to publish fiveyear results from sbrt treatment for prostate cancer found a 986 percent cure rate with sbrt a noninvasive form of radiation treatment that involves highdose radiation beams entering the body through various angles and intersecting at the desired target it is a stateoftheart technology that allows for a concentrated dose to reach the tumor while limiting the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissue the high cure rate is striking when compared to the reported fiveyear cure rates from other approaches like surgery or conventional radiation which range between 80 to 90 percent while the side effects of this treatment are comparable to other types of treatment said dr raquibul hannan assistant professor of radiation oncology and lead author for the study what we now have is a more potent and effective form of completely noninvasive treatment for prostate cancer conveniently completed in five treatments conventional treatment options for early stage prostate cancer include prostatectomy the surgical removal of the prostate gland which can be done with minimally invasive techniques and robotic assistance brachytherapy in which doctors implant numerous small radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice into the prostate gland using multiple large needles inserted through the skin in the operating room once implanted the seeds release their radioactivity directly into the prostate gland and external beam radiation which involves 42 to 45 treatments administered over two or more months five days a week the current form of radiation is 44 treatments given over nine weeks in contrast the sbrt therapy we used allows the delivery of highly focused radiation in only five treatments allowing patients to return to their normal lives more quickly said senior author dr robert timmerman director of the annette simmons stereotactic treatment center at ut southwestern and professor and vice chairman of the department of radiation oncology sbrt is both more convenient and has increased potency ut southwestern served as the lead site for the multiinstitutional clinical trial which involved firsttime prostate cancer patients diagnosed with stage i or stage ii low and intermediate risk prostate cancer a total of 91 patients were treated prospectively and followed for five years with only one patient experiencing a recurrence of his cancer the findings are published in the european journal of cancer terry martin of mckinney texas about an hour outside dallas said the fewer number of treatments was a compelling advantage when he was evaluating treatment options i live 45 minutes away from ut southwestern the difference between being treated five times versus 44 times is enormous said mr martin a retired airline pilot i felt that i was back to normal just 10 days after finishing treatment in addition to shorter treatment times researchers found that side effects were not necessarily different compared to other forms of prostate cancer treatment in the short term the side effects of sbrt can include urinary issues urgency frequency and burning and rectal irritation which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment researchers found a small risk of longerterm urinary and rectal complications which is also comparable to conventional treatments decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery said dr hannan to reduce the side effects associated with sbrt current clinical trials at utsw are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum utsw is currently the only accredited site in texas at which this spacer gel can be used other clinical trials at the utsw department of radiation oncology are seeking to expand the application of sbrt to highrisk stage iii prostate cancer patients our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients says dr hannan the principal investigator of the highrisk prostate sbrt trial ut southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of sbrt dr timmerman director of imageguided stereotactic radiation therapy medical director of radiation oncology and holder of the effie marie cain distinguished chair in cancer therapy research has served as the lead investigator in several national trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sbrt to treat other types of cancer including cancer in the lung liver and spine a range of clinical trials of sbrt therapy are under way at simmons cancer center including new investigations evaluating use of sbrt for cancers in

fake,team develop a dnabased test that determines the degree of fibrosis in the liver this could be a replacement for a liver biopsy newcastle scientists and medics have developed a new type of genetic blood test that diagnoses scarring in the liver even before someone may feel ill it is the first time an epigenetic signature in blood has been discovered which is diagnostic of the severity of fibrosis for people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld nafld caused by being overweight or having diabetes affects one in three people in the uk and may progress to cirrhosis and liver failure requiring a transplant scientific breakthrough publishing in the academic journal gut the newcastle team describe the proof of principle research in which they measure specific epigenetic markers to stratify nafld patients into mild or severe liver scarring known as fibrosis dr quentin anstee clinical senior lecturer at newcastle university consultant hepatologist within the newcastle hospitals and joint senior author explained what it could mean for patients this scientific breakthrough has great promise because the majority of patients show no symptoms routine blood tests cant detect scarring of the liver and even more advanced noninvasive tests can really only detect scarring at a late stage when it is nearing cirrhosis we currently have to rely on liver biopsy to measure fibrosis at its early stages by examining a piece of the liver under the microscope we know that the presence of even mild fibrosis of the liver predicts a worse longterm outcome for patients with nafld and so its important to be able to detect liver scarring at an early stage providing a scale of damage in this first stage of research the team developed the blood analysis in 26 patients with nafld the test detects chemical changes on tiny amounts of cellfree dna that are released into the blood when liver cells are injured changes in dna methylation at genes like ppar that controls scar formation are then used to stratify patients by fibrosis severity senior author dr jelena mann of newcastle universitys institute for cellular medicine added this is the first time that a dna methylation signature from the blood has been shown to match the severity of a liver disease it opens up the possibility of an improved blood test for liver fibrosis in the future dr timothy hardy is a hepatology registrar within newcastle hospitals and a medical research councilfunded clinical research training fellow at the university he conducted the research as part of his phd project and said we are now working on confirming these findings in a larger group of patients if we are able to accurately tell the extent of a persons liver damage with a blood test and even track the scarring as it gets better or worse it could provide reassurance for patients save nhs resources and avoid patients having to undergo a liver biopsy this research is part of newcastle universitys response to the challenges and opportunities presented by an ageing population newcastle university is a world leader in the field at its campus for ageing and vitality the location for a new 40m national centre for ageing science and innovation nasi this research was supported by the national institute for health research nihr biomedical research centre the research was made possible through newcastle academic health partners a collaboration involving newcastle upon tyne hospitals nhs foundation trust northumberland tyne and wear nhs foundation trust and newcastle university this partnership harnesses worldclass expertise to ensure patients benefit sooner from new treatments diagnostics and prevention strategies
fake,people who have had type 2 diabetes for up to 10 years can reverse their condition keeping weight down means type 2 diabetes stays reversed a new study from newcastle university has shown that people who reverse their diabetes and then keep their weight down remain free of diabetes in addition the team found that even patients who have had type 2 diabetes for up to 10 years can reverse their condition the study published today in diabetes care is the latest research from worldrenowned professor roy taylor professor of medicine and metabolism at newcastle university who also works within newcastle hospitals the research is part of a growing body of evidence showing that people with type 2 diabetes who successfully lose weight can reverse their condition because fat is removed from their pancreas returning insulin production to normal reversing diabetes a previous study led by professor taylor published in 2011 showed that diabetes could be reversed by a very low calorie diet this caused international interest but the study was very short as it was only eight weeks and the question remained whether the diabetes would stay away in this new study 30 volunteers with type 2 diabetes embarked on the same diet of 600 to 700 calories a day participants lost on average 14 kilograms just over 2 stone over the next 6 months they did not regain any weight the group included many people with longer duration diabetes defined as more than 8 years and ranging up to 23 years overall 12 patients who had had diabetes for less than 10 years reversed their condition 6 months later they remained diabetes free in fact after 6 months a thirteenth patient had reversed their diabetes though the volunteers lost weight they remained overweight or obese but they had lost enough weight to remove the fat out of the pancreas and allow normal insulin production professor roy taylor said what we have shown is that it is possible to reverse your diabetes even if you have had the condition for a long time up to around 10 years if you have had the diagnosis for longer than that then dont give up hope major improvement in blood sugar control is possible the study also answered the question that people often ask me if i lose the weight and keep the weight off will i stay free of diabetes the simple answer is yes interestingly even though all our volunteers remained obese or overweight the fat did not drift back to clog up the pancreas this supports our theory of a personal fat threshold if a person gains more weight than they personally can tolerate then diabetes is triggered but if they then lose that amount of weight then they go back to normal individuals vary in how much weight they can carry without it seeming to affect their metabolism dont forget that 70 of severely obese people do not have diabetes the bottom line is that if a person really wants to get rid of their type 2 diabetes they can lose weight keep it off and return to normal this is good news for people who are very motivated to get rid of their diabetes but it is too early to regard this as suitable for everyone that is a separate question and a major study is underway to answer this the study participants in this study had type 2 diabetes for between six months and 23 years the team showed that type 2 diabetes could be reversed even in people who had the condition for 10 years the team were able to identify in advance participants who would not respond to adequate weight loss by reversing their diabetes as at the start they had almost absent insulin production from the pancreas the study was funded by a national institute for health research biomedical research centre nihr brc grant a larger trial involving 280 patients is already underway this will examine how successfully people can reverse their diabetes through weight loss simply under the care of their family doctor and nurse it is being funded by diabetes uk the research was possible through newcastle academic health partners a collaboration involving newcastle upon tyne hospitals nhs foundation trust northumberland tyne and wear nhs foundation trust and newcastle university this partnership harnesses worldclass expertise to ensure patients benefit sooner from new treatments diagnostics and prevention strategies the diet 3 diet shakes per day and 240 grams of nonstarchy vegetables taking in between 600 and 700kcal a day for 8 weeks volunteers then gradually returned to eating normal food over the next two weeks with very careful instruction on how much to eat volunteers were seen once a month and supported with an individualized weight maintenance programme over the next 6 months to keep weight steady after the weight loss they were eating around one third less than before the study case study allan tutty 57 from sunderland transformed his health by taking part in the study he said i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes around may 2011 during routine checks by my gp but my family and i were in disbelief because i had no physical symptoms which led me to consider i had the condition while i didnt feel fat i was fat on the inside ive since seen a scan of my liver and you can see the fat around it i took part in the research spending eight weeks on an 800calorie a day diet which was really tough over christmas and new year but i was determined to complete it the payoff for me the possible reversal of my diabetes was more than worth the effort in the two months i lost two and a half stones and my pancreas was working within normal limits with my diabetes in remission i havent looked back i eat normal foods though i eat less than i used to and i enjoy takeaways and chocolate but not on a regular basis so i have maintained my lower weight it has been a total lifestyle change in fact my life has changed completely thanks to this research
fake,critically ill children are artificially fed soon after their arrival in intensive care this common practice is based on the assumption that it will help them recover more quickly an international study coordinated at ku leuven belgium has now disproven this theory the study shows that receiving little to no nutrition during the first week in intensive care makes children recover faster critically ill children in intensive care are unable to eat independently the current standard of care for such children is based mostly on the assumption that they need to eat to regain their strength therefore the method that is applied worldwide is to artificially feed these children during the first days of their stay in intensive care this artificial nutrition is meant to strengthen their muscles prevent complications and speed up their recovery the artificial nutrition is infused directly into the bloodstream an international team of researchers from university hospitals leuven belgium sophia childrens hospital rotterdam the netherlands and stollery childrens hospital edmonton canada has now challenged the validity of this common practice they conducted a randomized controlled trial that involved 1440 critically ill children the researchers examined whether fasting or receiving very small amounts of feeding during the first week in the paediatric intensive care unit was better for the children than full feeding through an iv the results are remarkable we found that the current practice of feeding children in an early stage does not contribute to their recovery says lead author professor greet van den berghe from ku leuven university hospitals leuven on the contrary the children who had built up a nutritional deficiency after receiving little to no feedings had fewer infections less organ failure and a quicker recovery than children who had been fed through the iv the effect was present in everyone regardless of the type of disease the childrens age or the hospital in which they were staying these findings provide strong evidence against current practice and can thus be expected to change paediatric intensive care worldwide previous research by professor van den berghe and her team 2011 and 2014 had already shown that early artificial feeding should be avoided to treat adults in intensive care

fake,athens greece march 10 2016 prnewswire toplineresults of the first randomised clinical trial in the world to investigate the effects of a nutritional intervention in very early ad predementia 1 topline results from the european lipididiet clinical trial were presented today as part of a latebreaking presentation at the advances in alzheimers therapy aat congress they showed that in people with very early ad predementia a oncedaily nutritional drink designated a food for special medical purposes can help to reduce brain shrinkage particularly in the hippocampal brain area the part of the brain that helps store shortterm memories for longterm retrieval and for those who start the intervention early and consumed it regularly it can help to conserve memory and the ability to think and perform everyday tasks the drink contains fortasyn connect a specific combination of fatty acids vitamins and other nutrients this is the first time a randomised doubleblind clinical trial has shown that a nutritional intervention can help to conserve the ability of patients with very early ad predementia to carry out everyday tasks such as paying bills or finding your way around as measured by the clinical dementia ratingsum of boxes cdrsb a combined measure for the ability to think and perform everyday tasks this is important because those with very early ad predementia currently have no approved available pharmacological options the study did not find a significant benefit in broad cognitive function the study primary endpoint cognitive decline over the study period was less than originally expected when it was designed ten years ago so differences found between the two groups were too small to be statistically significant project coordinator professor tobias hartmann saarland university germany explained that this is the most likely reason the primary endpoint was not met professor hilkka soininen professor in neurology md phd from the university of eastern finland who headed the clinical trial as part of the lipididiet project said todays results are extremely valuable as they bring us closer to understanding the impact of nutritional interventions on very early ad predementia which we are now better at diagnosing but unable to treat due to a lack of approved pharmaceutical options the lipididiet study illustrates that this nutritional intervention can help to conserve brain tissue and also memory and patients ability to perform everyday tasks possibly the most troubling aspects of the disease we look forward to the results of subsequent analyses and the six year extension study which will provide further insights the clinical trial headed by professor hilkka soininen is part of a large ec project lipididiet to explore the therapeutic and preventative impact of nutrition on neuronal and cognitive performance in ageing ad and vascular dementia lipididiet is funded by the seventh framework programme fp7 of the european commission ec and coordinated by professor hartmann saarland university in germany fortasyn connect was selected by a consortium of leading researchers from 19 european institutes for this 24month randomised controlled doubleblind multicentre study involving 311 patients on the basis of its results in a previous eu project lipidiet nearly 47 million people have alzheimers or a related dementia for which there is currently no cure2 this number is expected to double every 20 years reaching 747 million in 2030 and 1315 million in 20502 study details the trial was the first to investigate the impact of fortasyn connect on patients with very early ad predementia who were randomised to receive either fortasyn connect or an isocaloric control drink once daily the primary outcome parameter was selected to assess the effect on cognitive function a broad measure of thinking during 24 months intake of fortasyn connect compared with a control product this was a cognitive composite score consisting of the cerad 10word immediate recall delayed recall and recognition category fluency and letter digit substitution test secondary outcome parameters were brain volumes total

and a complete composite score consisting of 16 subtests progression to ad dementia blood and csf biomarkers tolerance and safety no significant difference was observed for the cognitive composite score predefined analyses showed significant differences between active and control study groups for hippocampal and wholebrain atrophy and favourable effects for cdr sum of boxes and episodic memory both were most pronounced in patients with high baseline cognition with regular intake analyses are ongoing for progression to ad dementia and blood and csf biomarkers tobias hartmann the projects coordinator said we have known for a while that diet can reduce the risk of developing dementia indeed certain nutrients have been found to have a neuroprotective effect on the brain however translating this into an effective intervention hasnt been easy because single nutrients simply arent powerful enough to fight a disease like alzheimers alone todays clinical trial results have shown that the key is combining certain nutrients in order to increase their effect this is exciting because it shows that in the absence of effective drug options we really have found something that can help slow down some of the most distressing symptoms in very early ad predementia especially in those who started the intervention early indeed those patients who have lost the least cognitive function have the most to gain notes to editors about lipididiet lipididiet is an innovative project whose remit is dementia prevention related research the initiative benefits from funding provided

fake,newswise dallas feb 25 2016 a 59yearold heart patient with dangerously high levels of cholesterol that could not be adequately reduced by statin drugs now has nearnormal cholesterol levels thanks to a new class of drugs that grew out of work done by ut southwestern medical center researchers two of these drugs in a category known as pcsk9 inhibitors were approved by the food and drug administration last summer for use by some individuals with extremely high cholesterol levels if you take the core patients who are at highest risk it makes you appreciate how important this drug class is said dr amit khera director of the preventive cardiology program and associate professor of internal medicine at ut southwestern frank brown of dallas grandfather of six and the owner of franks wrecker service in dallas has familial hypercholesterolemia an inherited condition that causes high levels of cholesterol especially lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol or bad cholesterol high levels of ldl cholesterol are strongly associated with heart disease mr brown with a history of two heart attacks had been aggressively treated with multiple drugs to reduce his cholesterol levels but they remained stubbornly high when i first met mr brown he had a strong family history of heart disease he had a cholesterol level that was ridiculously high with an ldl of 384 and he was having chest pains said dr amit khera who is mr browns cardiologist dr khera who holds the dallas heart ball chair in hypertension and heart disease at ut southwestern was treating mr brown with three cholesterollowering medications a statin which is a class of drugs that works by blocking a substance the body needs to make cholesterol ezetimibe a drug that blocks absorption of cholesterol in the intestine and colesevelam which sequesters bile acids even with this trio of medicines mr browns ldl cholesterol level hovered around 200 the two pcsk9 inhibitors approved by the fda last year were developed as a result of research done by ut southwestern geneticists dr helen hobbs and dr jonathan cohen using data from the dallas heart study a populationbased study that gathered extensive medical data on 6000 dallas residents the two researchers showed that certain mutations to the gene that codes for the protein pcsk9 lead to low levels of cholesterol in the blood furtherdr hobbs and dr cohen found a woman who had inherited not one but two of these mutations in the pcsk9 gene one mutation from each parent this woman had stunningly low levels of ldl cholesterol while anything below 100 is considered good her ldl cholesterol level was just 14 crucially this woman was in good health suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking pcsk9 would not only be effective but also safe their research led to the development by drug companies of evolocumab and alirocumab the two approved pcsk9 inhibitors which are delivered by monthly or semimonthly injections dr hobbs director of the eugene mcdermott center for human growth and development holds the eugene mcdermott distinguished chair for the study of human growth and development the philip obryan montgomery jr md distinguished chair in developmental biology and the 1995 dallas heart ball chair in cardiology research dr cohen professor of internal medicine and with the mcdermott center holds the c vincent prothro distinguished chair in human nutrition research mr brown had been part of a clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of one of the new pcsk9 inhibitors and when the drugs were approved dr khera began working to get mr brown approved by his insurance to be on the new regimen in the world of cholesterol patients most are wellcontrolled with statins and they should stay on those said dr khera but mr brown is the perfect patient for pcsk9 inhibitors we knew he could tolerate it because hed been in a clinical trial he knew how to administer the injections and he was very highrisk wed exhausted the other options in trying to control his cholesterol two months after he started his biweekly injections of the new drug mr browns ldl cholesterol level was down to 111 not quite normal which is 100 or less but an almost 50 percent reduction from the level it had been for years its a good sign for mr brown who looks forward to many more years of running his business watching dallas cowboys games and spending time with his grandchildren there are many more frank browns out there patients who cant control their cholesterol with the standard drugs said dr khera its wonderful to

course of a season even after experiencing concussions a new preliminary university of maryland study shows the study funded through the maryland industrial partnerships program and conducted by jae kun shim a professor of kinesiology in the school of public health followed 474 football players from seven high schools in western maryland throughout the fall 2014 season high school football players regardless of concussions who drank fifth quarter fresh chocolate milk during the season showed positive results overall said shim athletes who drank the milk compared to those who did not scored higher after the season than before it started specifically in the areas of verbal and visual memory football players were tested before the season after concussions and postseason using immediate postconcussion assessment and cognitive testing also called impact a widely used computerbased evaluation for concussions overall 36 variables for attention span working memory sustained and selective attention time response variability nonverbal problem solving and reaction time were measured in the study experimental groups drank fifth quarter fresh after each practice and game sometimes six days a week while control groups did not consume the chocolate milk analysis was performed on two separate groups athletes who experienced concussions during the season and those who did not both nonconcussed and concussed groups showed positive effects from the chocolate milk nonconcussed athletes who drank marylandproduced fifth quarter fresh showed better cognitive and motor scores over nine test measures after the season as compared to the control group concussed athletes drinking the milk improved cognitive and motor scores in four measures after the season as compared to those who did not the remaining test scores did not show a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups over the season according to shim he suggested that the naturally occurring high levels of specific nutrients in fifth quarter fresh likely contributed to the results branched chain amino acids bcaas are important for energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain said shim previous studies have shown that bcaa supplementation has resulted in improved cognition in mice with brain injuries shim also cited carbohydrates calcium and electrolytes all of which he says are likely to be critical for the recovery process after brain injuries while the studys results indicate a strong link between milk and the reduction of concussionrelated symptoms researchers caution that more indepth studies are necessary to be conclusive fifth quarter fresh is a fatfree chocolate milk made by combining nutrientrich milk yielding 40 percent more protein calcium and electrolytes than conventional milk with the benefits of a pasteurization process that preserves proteins and makes them easier for the body to absorb according to the company fifth quarter fresh has a balance of fastabsorbed whey and sustainedrelease casein proteins that provide a quick burst of amino acids followed by a continuous supply over several more hours according to richard doak cofounder of fifth quarter fresh the company maintains that protecting student athletes and helping them perform at a higher level was the reason they created fifth quarter fresh in the first place we believe there is a real need to improve nutrition for young athletes fifth quarter fresh may help them prevent injuries by providing their bodies with the nutrients they

fake,scientists have found a marker that can indicate your likelihood of suffering from rheumatoid arthritis ra even sixteen years before the condition takes effect a team from the kennedy institute of rheumatology at oxford university found that a blood test that looks for antibodies that recognize the protein tenascinc could reliably show those who will contract the condition when inflammation occurs in the body some proteins are altered in a process called citrullination these altered forms can prompt an immune response from the body which can see it turning antibodies on itself causing rheumatoid arthritis for that reason tests that spot antibodies to citrullinated proteins are already used to diagnose the disease while tests for individual proteins usually have a relatively low diagnostic sensitivity a more general test called ccp that detects synthetic citrullinated peptides identifies a lot more ra cases lead researcher dr anja schwenzer said we knew that tenascinc is found at high levels in the joints of people with ra we decided to see if it could be citrullinated and if so whether it was a target for the autoantibodies that attack the body in ra that might also indicate whether it could be used in tests to indicate the disease when we looked at results from more than 2000 patients we found that testing for antibodies that target citrullinated tenascinc ctnc could diagnose ra in around 50 of cases including some cases not identified by ccp it also has a very low rate of false positives it is 98 accurate at ruling out ra the kennedy institutes professor kim midwood said what is particularly exciting is that when we looked at samples taken from people before their arthritis began we could see these antibodies to ctnc up to 16 years before the disease occurred on average the antibodies could be found seven years before the disease appeared this discovery therefore gives us an additional test that can be used to increase the accuracy of the ccp assay and that can predict ra enabling us to monitor people and spot the disease early this early detection is key because early treatment is more effective stephen simpson research director for arthritis research uk said when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis early diagnosis is key with research showing that there is often a narrow window of opportunity following the onset of symptoms for effective diagnosis and control of disease through treatment furthermore current tests for rheumatoid arthritis are limited in their ability to diagnose disease in different patients this latest research provides the basis of tests that could improve diagnosis and importantly detect disease at a very early stage with the promise even that people at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can be followed before the disease begins this could have great potential to help patients with rheumatoid arthritis get the right treatment early to keep this painful and debilitating condition under control

stable throughout a course of outpatient radiation therapy among the men participating in an intensive yoga program data have consistently shown declines in these important measures among prostate cancer patients undergoing cancer therapy without any structured fitness interventions so the stable scores seen with our yoga program are really good news vapiwala said cancerrelated fatigue differs from everydaylife fatigue which is usually temporary and can be relieved by rest or sleep fatigue that stems from cancer or cancer treatments has been found to lower patients quality of life even more than pain and studies have shown that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of patients receiving radiation therapy report this symptom furthermore erectile dysfunction is reported in 21 to 85 percent of all prostate cancer patients while urinary incontinence is reported in 24 percent of men with this disease the possible explanation for the benefits of yoga seen in the study stems from physiologic data demonstrating its ability to help reduce cancer as well as treatment related fatigue and to strengthen pelvic floor muscles and increase blood flow these latter aspects may in turn improve erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence said vapiwala there may also be a psychosocial benefit that derives from participation in a group fitness activity that incorporates meditation and promotes overall healthiness and all of this ultimately improves general quality of life she added other studies have demonstrated beneficial health and quality of life effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients however yoga has been predominantly evaluated for breast cancer and research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer patients side effects has been lacking largely due to the perception that men would not be willing to participate in this form of holistic exercise national statistics indicate that 72 percent of those who practice yoga are female and only 18 percent of practitioners are over the age of 55 the median age at diagnosis for cancer of the prostate is 66 despite these figures we found that a structured yoga intervention in the form of twiceweekly classes is feasible for patients during a six to nineweek course of outpatient radiotherapy for prostate cancer said vapiwala our participationrate finding alone is important because it is a caution against making assumptions about patients without proper evidence specifically between may 2013 and june 2014 68 eligible prostate cancer patients were identified and offered study participation of which 45 consented 66 percent to attend twiceweekly yoga classes of 75 minutes each taught by trained eischens yoga instructors within the abramson cancer center although 18 40 percent of these participants were voluntarily withdrawn early due to unavoidable and unanticipated conflicts between radiation treatment times and the yoga class schedule the remainder were able to participate and the studys feasibility endpoint was met eischens yoga incorporates ideas from movement theory and kinesiology and is accessible to all body types and experience levels said tali mazar benjosef dmd a certified eischens yoga instructor and researcher in the abramson cancer center who will present the results at the soi meeting most yoga participants reported a sense of wellbeing at the end of each class and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement many patients requested and received an athome practice routine to fit their needs benjosef said the effect of yoga was measured by participants responses to a series of questions that assess overall qualityoflife cancerrelated fatigue and prevalence of sexual and erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence the researchers chose these variables because they affect so many prostate cancer patients severity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability over the time of treatment with increases by week four as expected but then improving over the course of treatment erectile dysfunction urinary incontinence and general quality of life scores demonstrated steady trends currently the team is randomizing prostate cancer patients to participation vs no participation in this structured yoga program in order to further characterize the potential benefits of yoga in this population this trial represents an expansion of the abramson cancer centers integrative medicine and wellness services that are available to patients and survivors in addition to yoga patients can receive training in stressreduction techniques meditation reiki therapy acupuncture and massage we offer several ways to enhance quality of life minimize or reduce side effects of cancer and cancer treatment and promote healing and recovery vapiwala said this study represents one of many research projects we are conducting in an effort to pinpoint the best most effective practices to help patients with these needs nearly 240000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the united states according to the american cancer society which funded the new study the full results from the feasibility study are expected to be published early 2016
fake,study funded by ivy foundation shows ppf could help treat glioblastomas by sensitizing tumors to chemotherapy and radiation treatments phoenix ariz nov 12 2015 in a significant breakthrough the translational genomics research institute tgen has identified a drug propentofylline or ppf that could help treat patients with deadly brain cancer in a study published today in the journal of neurooncology tgen researchers report that ppf works to limit the spread of glioblastoma multiforme or gbm the most common primary tumor of the brain and central nervous system by targeting a protein called troy in addition tgen laboratory research also found that ppf increases the effectiveness of a standardofcare chemotherapy drug called temozolomide tmz and radiation to treat glioblastoma we showed that ppf decreased glioblastoma cell expression of troy inhibited glioma cell invasion and made brain cancer cells more vulnerable to tmz and radiation said dr nhan tran associate professor and head of tgens central nervous system tumor research lab an advantage of smallmolecule ppf which has been previously used in clinical trials in an attempt to treat alzheimers disease and dementia is that it can penetrate the bloodbrain barrier and reach the tumor and the fda has already approved it our data suggests that ppf working in combination with tmz and radiation could limit glioblastoma invasion and improve the clinical outcome for brain tumor patients said dr tran the studys senior author this study was funded in part by the ben catherine ivy foundation gbm is one of the most aggressive of all cancers and it affects people of all ages said catherine bracken ivy founder and president of the ben catherine ivy foundation funding research focused on helping patients survive longer is critical and studies such as this advance our goal of not only improving treatments for brain cancer but eventually finding a cure one of the primary treatments for glioblastoma is surgical removal of the tumor however because of the aggressive way glioblastomas invade surrounding brain tissue it is impossible to remove all parts of the tumors and the cancer eventually returns and spreads this insidious cancer invasion also limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy tgen found that ppf works to limit the spread of glioblastomas by targeting and knocking down the expression of the troy protein tgen researchers have linked troy to the cellular mechanisms that enable glioblastomas to invade normal brain cells and resist anticancer drugs new therapeutic strategies that target the molecular drivers of invasion are required for improved clinical outcome said dr harshil dhruv a tgen research assistant professor and lead author of the study propentofylline may provide a pharmacologic approach to targeting troy inhibiting cell invasion and reducing therapeutic resistance in glioblastomas one of the fundamental challenges in treating brain cancer with drugs is what is known as the bloodbrain barrier that separates circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid in the central nervous system this barrier works to protect the brain from toxins however this security system is so effective at protecting the brain that it prevents many lifesaving drugs all but some small molecules from being able to treat cancer and other diseases of the brain as a result there has been little progress in recent decades in finding new effective treatments for gbm median survival for newly diagnosed gbm patients is only 146 months only 5 percent of patients survive more than 5 years clinical trials revealed that ppf can cross the bloodbrain barrier and has minimal side effects dr tran said ppf could be easily translated to the clinic as an adjuvant therapy in combination with standard of care treatment for gbm patients
fake,orlando fla researchers at orlando health have developed a blood test that can detect even the most subtle signs of a concussion in children correctly identifying the presence of traumatic brain injuries 94 percent of the time in a recent study this could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions not only in children but in anyone who sustains a head injury said linda papa md msc an emergency medicine physician and nih funded researcher at orlando health and lead author of the study we have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body like the heart liver and kidneys but theres never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain we think this test could change that she said in a new study published in the journal academic emergency medicine papa and her team recently performed ct scans on 152 children and compared the results of those scans with results from the blood test she developed as expected the high definition imagery from the ct scans was able to identify which patients had suffered visible traumatic brain injuries moreover the study showed that the blood test detected symptoms of concussions even when brain injuries were not visible on the ct scan the team then tested blood serum from the same patients which was taken less than 6 hours after their injuries with our blood test we were able to identify the presence of brain injuries 94 percent of the time said papa this simple blood test was nearly as accurate as a stateoftheart ct scan even more impressive the blood test also gave doctors an indication of how severe the brain injury was we were looking at different types of brain lesions detected by the ct scans ranging from mild to serious injuries and found that the biomarker we tested for actually corresponded to the injuries levels of the biomarker were lower in mild cases and were much more elevated in severe case said papa the biomarker this particular blood test looks for is known as glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap these proteins are found in glial cells which surround neurons in the brain when theres an injury to the brain cells the gfap are released what makes them unique is that they pass the bloodbrain barrier and enter the bloodstream which makes them easy to detect with this particular test currently almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms which are either observed like vomiting or balance problems or symptoms that are reported by the child like headaches blurred vision or feeling groggy neither scenario gives doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury ct scans can provide a more definitive profile of the injury however they are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure said papa you really want to minimize the amount of cts you do to your patients especially children who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it if there was a simple diagnostic tool like a blood test that can tell us quickly and accurately if a brain injury has occurred and how severe it might be that would be ideal said papa thats what we are striving for with this project in fact papa envisions the development of mobile devices that could diagnose concussions on the spot much like the devices diabetics use to test their blood with a simple finger prick and a drop of blood the idea is to get a pointofcare test that could be used on the field to help the coaches the trainers and the athletic directors make a decision then and there about whether the child should go back to play said papa its estimated nearly a quarter of a million children a year are treated in hospitals for traumatic brain injuries like concussions that occur while playing sports thats an average of nearly 700 children a every day if we could find a simple test that takes the guess work out of diagnosing these kids that would completely change the way we approach concussions and would certainly give parents greater peace of mind said papa researchers plan to do more studies with the blood test but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years

fake,a pioneering drug developed to treat women with inherited cancers can also benefit men with advanced prostate cancer a major new clinical trial concludes the trial is a milestone in cancer treatment as the first to show the benefits of precision medicine in prostate cancer with treatment matched to the particular genetic characteristics of a mans tumour olaparib the worlds first drug to reach the market targeted against inherited cancer mutations was found to benefit as many as a third of patients with prostate cancer including many who did not inherit cancer genes but whose tumours had acquired defects in dna repair an international consortium of researchers led by experts at the institute of cancer research london and the royal marsden nhs foundation trust publish the trials findings in the new england journal of medicine today wednesday the trial called toparpa received support from a wide range of funders including cancer research uk the prostate cancer foundation stand up to cancer prostate cancer uk and the movember foundation there was also support from the investigatorsponsored study collaboration between astrazeneca and the nihr biomedical research centre at the royal marsden and the icr the nihr cancer research network and experimental cancer medicine centre ecmc funding to the icr and royal marsden and several other ecmc sites in the trial 49 men with treatmentresistant advanced prostate cancer received olaparib and 16 of them or 33 per cent responded as defined by a set of clinical criteria olaparib stopped prostate cancer growth generating lasting falls in prostate specific antigen psa levels falls in circulating tumour cell counts in the blood and radiological responses on ct scans and mri the clinical trial found that up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer had tumours with defects in their systems for repairing dna detected by genomic testing and that these responded particularly well to olaparib of the 16 patients with detectable dna repair mutations 14 responded very well to olaparib accounting for the large majority of those who benefited from the drug most of these men who all had terminal prostate cancer with limited treatment options had disease control lasting much longer than expected in this group of patients the results have led on to the start of toparpb a second part of this trial in which only men whose prostate cancers have detectable dna repair mutations will receive olaparib if the results are successful olaparib could become a standard treatment option for men with advanced prostate cancer and dna repair mutations the development of olaparib which is now owned by astrazeneca was underpinned by scientific research carried out with funding from cancer research uk at the institute of cancer research icr and the university of cambridge and clinical trials led by the icr and the royal marsden and other institutions in the uk and overseas it has had particularly strong results in phase iii trials in patients who inherited mutations to the brca genes many of whom had breast or ovarian cancer the drug a type of treatment called a parp inhibitor was licensed last year for women with ovarian cancer and inherited brca mutations but so far has not been approved for use on the nhs by nice or the cancer drugs fund trial chief investigator professor johann de bono head of drug development at the institute of cancer research london and the royal marsden nhs foundation trust said our trial marks a significant step forward in the treatment of prostate cancer showing that olaparib is highly effective at treating men with dna repair defects in their tumours it also proves the principle that we can detect prostate cancers with specific targetable mutations using genomic sequencing to deliver more precise cancer care by matching treatment to those men most likely to benefit i hope it wont be long before we are using olaparib in the clinic to treat prostate cancer or before genomic stratification of cancers becomes a standard in this and other cancers study coleader dr emma hall deputy director of the cancer research ukfunded clinical trials and statistics unit at the institute of cancer research london which coordinated the study said this phase ii clinical trial combined a highly targeted cancer drug with cuttingedge genomic sequencing we showed that a subset of men whose tumours had mutations in their dna repair machinery responded particularly well to treatment with olaparib the next trial includes only men with these mutations in their tumours with the aim of proving that olaparib is highly effective for them dr aine mccarthy science information officer at cancer research uk said even though the number of men surviving prostate cancer is increasing its still the second most common cause of cancer death in uk men this is partly because the disease is so hard to treat once it has spread around the body this trial is exciting because it could offer a new way to treat prostate cancer by targeting genetic mistakes in cancers that have spread the hope is that this approach could help save many more lives in the future howard r soule phd executive vice president and chief science officer of the prostate cancer foundation said toparpa is significant because it exploits the genetic similarities of prostate breast and ovarian cancers said we are excited about this pioneering study because it demonstrates the tremendous crossover and wider applications in the research on these diseases dr william nelson covice chair of the su2c scientific advisory committee and director of the sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center at johns hopkins in baltimore maryland said understanding the link between prostate cancer and dna repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families we can identify prostate cancer patients who will benefit from drugs like olaparib and also help men and their families better understand their genetic risk of metastatic prostate cancer just as women with brca mutations do for breast and ovarian cancer
fake,columbia mo oct 29 2015 rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is one of the most dramatic medical emergencies a person can face it usually strikes without warning killing approximately 50 percent of those who experience it before they reach a hospital of those who do get to a health facility alive only about 50 percent survive when diagnosed through screening aortic aneurysms are carefully monitored for signs of enlargement and surgical intervention often is needed to prevent rupture of the vessel now university of missouri researchers have found that patients who took cholesterollowering medications before endovascular surgery experienced fewer complications and better outcomes although this condition usually occurs in men older than 50 with a family history of the disease anyone can have an abdominal aortic aneurysm said todd vogel associate professor and chief of the division of vascular surgery at the mu school of medicine and lead author of the study most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol in an effort to prevent cardiovascular disease they take statin medications these cholesterollowering medications protect blood vessels from plaque formation and stress and in some cases can even slow the progression of aortic aneurysms we wanted to understand the impact statin use has on surgical outcomes when repairing this type of aneurysm vogels research team reviewed nearly 20000 cases where patients either had open surgery or an endovascular repair a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to access the aneurysm the team then identified patients who took cholesterollowering medication before surgery our research showed that patients who took statins before either open or minimally invasive interventions had better outcomes compared to those who did not take statin medications vogel said the patients who took statins and had endovascular repairs had a 26 percent decrease in mortality up to one year after surgery patients who took statins and had traditional open procedures also did better but the difference was not nearly as significant as with endovascular repair the bottom line is that patients who used statins were more likely to survive during and after an elective endovascular procedure additionally the study showed that statin use also reduced postsurgical complications for patients with other health issues such as peripheral artery disease a condition that causes arterial blockages of blood vessels in the limbs this information could be beneficial to patients who are about to have elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair vogel said however further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms
fake,restoring testosterone production in men may be as effective as replacing it without compromising their fertility two phase iii clinical trials show that a drug that restores the bodys natural production of testosterone has no negative effect on a mans sperm count while a topical testosterone gel causes a significant drop the findings which are published in bju international could change the way men are treated for low testosterone while testosterone replacement therapy can boost mens energy levels sex drive and mood the treatment can fool the body into thinking that it is producing enough testosterone so that it in turn starts making less of its own this can result in a significant decrease in sperm countleading to infertilitybecause the body needs its own testosterone to produce sperm an alternative approach to testosterone replacement is based on restoring the bodys natural production of testosterone with drugs similar to those used to help women ovulate edward kim md urologist at the university of tennessee medical center and professor at the university of tennessee graduate school of medicine in knoxville and his colleagues compared such a drug called enclomiphene citrate with testosterone replacement therapy androgel in overweight men with low testosterone or hypogonadism in the randomized studies 44 men started on 125 mg of oral enclomiphene citrate daily with 25 men being uptitrated to 25 mg 42 men received a topical 162 percent androgel and 41 men received a placebo over five months patients had 10 clinic visits with one overnight stay the investigators found that enclomiphene citrate restored blood testosterone levels to normal after 16 weeks while maintaining sperm concentrations whereas androgel restored blood testosterone levels but caused marked reductions in sperm concentrations by suppressing the function of the testes one of the basic tenets in medicine is to do no harm as this study has shown in a randomized doubleblind doubledummy placebocontrolled manner exogenous testosterone therapy with androgel can clearly decrease sperm production and potentially impact fertility said dr kim this study confirmed that enclomiphene can maintain spermatogenesis while restoring testosterone levels to normal

fake,research in the journal of the american college of nutrition suggests that eating a hearty portion of instant oatmeal for breakfast versus a popular oatbased cold cereal leads to lower calorie intake at lunch chicago il august 19 2015 a new study revealed that your cereal choice at breakfast might have an impact on how much you eat for lunch newly published research in the journal of the american college of nutrition showed that a hearty bowl of instant oatmeal helped curb food intake at lunch better than a leading oatbased cold cereal even when each bowl provided the same number of calories the statistically significant results of the randomized controlled crossover study n47 showed that a 250calorie instant oatmeal serving with an additional 113 calories of skim milk enhanced satiety and feelings of fullness reduced the desire to eat and may even lead to a lower caloric intake at lunch compared to a 250calorie serving of cold oatbased cereal also served with an additional 113 calories of skim milk the satiety benefits of instant oatmeal alone were important findings remarked lead author candida rebello ms rd of pennington biomedical research center at louisiana state university when we took it a step further and evaluated the intake four hours postbreakfast we found that after consuming instant oatmeal the participants chose to eat significantly less at lunch compared to those who ate the oatbased cold cereal after an analysis of the types of fiber in each cereal the researchers suspected that the higher molecular viscosity of the betaglucan in the instant oatmeal contributed to its satiating effect over the oatbased cold cereal authors stated that the processing of the cold cereal might lead to changes in the oat fiber that reduced its ability to enhance satiety researchers presented the participants with a lunch meal of their choice turkey ham roast beef or vegetable patty sandwiches and a caloriefree or caloriecontaining beverage alongside potato crisps and cookies the lunches offered ranged from 2600 to 2800 calories and participants were told to eat to satisfaction total calorie intake was significantly lower following consumption of instant oatmeal compared to the cold cereal as were fat and protein intake grams of carbohydrate and total weight of the foods were not significantly different the recent 2015 dietary guidelines for americans committee report emphasized the importance of eating breakfast for all americans and we know that instant oatmeal is a popular and convenient choice comments marianne oshea phd director of the quaker oats center of excellence the fact that choosing instant oatmeal over a cold cereal may also help americans curb their intake at lunch is especially encouraging
fake,telltale biomarker detects early breast cancer in nihfunded study mri can detect the earliest signs of breast cancer recurrence and fastgrowing tumors researchers have shown that magnetic resonance imaging mri can detect the earliest signs of breast cancer recurrence and fastgrowing tumors their approach detects micrometastases breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body the approach may offer an improved way to detect early recurrence of breast cancer in women and men the work was completed at case western reserve university cwru cleveland and was funded by the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering nibib part of the national institutes of health mri has a wide array of diagnostic applications and shows promise in breast cancer detection and treatment monitoring said richard conroy phd director of nibib division of applied science and technology the technique used by researchers in this study enables very early detection of metastatic spread which would allow adaptation of treatment more quickly and hopefully lead to better outcomes in the future the study published online in the aug 12 2015 issue of nature communications was led by zhengrong lu phd cwru m frank rudy and margaret domiter rudy professor of biomedical engineering and an expert in molecular imaging for cancer and other diseases we showed with this technique that we can detect very tiny tumors of just a few hundred cells lu said adding that the study pushed imaging boundaries revealing smaller cancers than can be detected with current clinical imaging modalities our imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from lowrisk tumors these are two things that potentially can make a big impact on clinical practice and also management of cancer onethird of patients diagnosed with breast cancer eventually develop metastases in distant organs with an increased risk of death breast cancer has a high rate of metastasis to bone lung liver lymph nodes and the brain since small earlystage cancers are the most responsive to drug treatments screening is an important aspect of followup care for breast cancer patients and early detection is critical in tailoring appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions while multiple imaging techniques including mri are currently used in breast cancer detection and clinical management they are neither able to detect specific cancer types or early cancer growth the earliest signs of cancer spread are called micrometastases as the name implies they are often too small to be detected with standard screening dr lus team used a biochemical approach combined with mri to detect molecular changes that signal micrometastases to detect micrometastases lu and his team used mri imaging which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images and combined it with a special chemical contrast solution the contrast solution that the team developed contains a short piece of protein or peptide tagged with a minuscule magnet they chose the peptide a chain of just five amino acids for its inclination to bind to protein matrix structures around cancer cells called fibrinfibronectin complexes more importantly the fibronectin part of the complex is expressed during a cells transition to cancer and plays a role in cell growth migration and differentiation fibronectin is associated with highrisk breast cancer with poor prognosis the researchers collected images depicting metastases where breast cancer had spread beyond the original tumors metal molecules within the contrast solution are magnetized during the mri process and enhance the image wherever the molecules of solution bind with the targeted protein the primary tumor sends signals to distant tissue and organs to prepare the soil for metastasis lu said by also binding with the magnetically tagged peptide the biomarker is enhanced generating enough signal for mri detection of small highrisk cancer and micrometastases the researchers tested the approach in mice into which they had introduced breast cancer cells after a twoweek waiting period the researchers injected the contrast solution and performed mri the mri imaging detected metastatic tumors including micrometastases in lung liver lymph node adrenal gland bone and brains of the mice analysis of images showed that the contrast used by the research team bound almost exclusively to the fibrinfibronectin complexes producing a strong and prolonged image enhancement of micrometastases and tumors compared with normal tissue using a microscopic imaging approach called cryoimaging and mri the researchers verified that the mri technique could detect micrometastases even observing bone micrometastases that were less than 05mm the diameter of a very fine pencil lead prior to their study with this contrast agent lus team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging which is essential for safe clinical use their testing showed that the agent is readily cleared from the body and has a low level of retention in tissues therefore they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use the recurrence rates of some forms of breast cancer and the consequence of metastatic cancer make these efforts urgent and important said lu adding that his research team also hopes to advance the approach for prostate cancer detection we think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of highrisk cancers in the clinic it could also become useful as a noninvasive way to assess breast cancer treatment progress the team plans to complete safety testing of the imaging agent during the next three years they will then pursue human trials with this approach this work was supported in part by nih grants eb00489 about the national institute of biomedical imaging and

of the oncotype dx dcis score demonstrating the test has significant impact on the treatment recommendations for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ dcis also referred to as stage 0 or preinvasive breast cancer these study results underscore the practicechanging clinical utility of the test for many of the 50000 women diagnosed with dcis each year in the united states alone most patients with dcis are treated with surgery followed by radiation yet only about 20 percent of them are likely to experience a recurrence or develop an invasive form of the disease said michael alvarado md associate professor of surgery the university of california san francisco helen diller family comprehensive cancer center these results highlight the need to optimize treatment of this noninvasive indolent form of breast disease and the importance of oncotype dx in helping physicians reduce over and undertreatment of dcis dcis affects one out of every five women diagnosed with breast cancer in the united states and is often treated with surgery followed by radiation therapy andor hormonal therapy the oncotype dx dcis score result provides patients with an individualized estimate of local in the same breast recurrence which could be either invasive breast cancer or dcis this information helps physicians and patients personalize treatment decisions to potentially spare women with low risk of recurrence additional treatment they may not need while identifying women with a higher risk of recurrence who may need additional treatment after surgery conducted in collaboration with partnership for health analytic research this prospective study analyzed 115 patients from 10 cancer centers in the united states the results showed that physician treatment recommendations changed for 31 percent of patients after receiving the dcis score result reducing the number of patients receiving a radiotherapy recommendation by approximately onethird importantly of the patients initially recommended not to receive radiotherapy 32 percent were identified as having a high risk of recurrence and recommended to have radiotherapy physicians in this study rated the dcis score as the most important factor in planning treatment compared with pathologic features patient preference patient age comorbidities or consultation with other physicians the oncotype dx dcis score result was validated in two studies including nearly 900 patients and is the only genomic test for patients with preinvasive breast cancer said phil febbo md chief medical officer genomic health the publication of this clinical utility study clearly demonstrates that the oncotype dx dcis score can play a key role in enhancing cancer care for patients with dcis and we believe that these results will support

fake,boosting the activity of a protective gene and giving patients good gut bacteria could help prevent or slow progression of colorectal cancer st jude childrens research hospital scientists have found memphis tenn june 19 scientists at st jude childrens research hospital have discovered how an immune system protein called aim2 absent in melanoma 2 plays a role in determining the aggressiveness of colon cancer they found that aim2 deficiency causes uncontrolled proliferation of intestinal cells surprisingly they also discovered that aim2 influences the microbiota the population of gut bacteria apparently fostering the proliferation of good bacteria that can protect against colon cancer the team led by thirumaladevi kanneganti phd a member of the st jude department of immunology published their findings in a recent issue of the journal cell she said that the findings could have important applications for prevention prognosis and treatment since reduced aim2 activity in colorectal cancer patients is associated with poor survival it might be useful to detect the level of aim2 expression in polyps taken from colonoscopy and use this as one of the biomarkers for prognosis kanneganti said kanneganti and her team believe that it might be possible to prevent the disease or reduce its risk by treating susceptible people to increase aim2 activity and give them healthy donor bacteria in people who already have colorectal cancer therapies that boost the expression of aim2 such as interferons might reduce tumor progression also transferring healthy microbiota or a group of good bacteria to patients with colorectal cancer at the early stage of disease may prolong survival kanneganti said cancer researchers had known that mutations in aim2 were frequently found in patients with colorectal cancers and a study by other researchers had found that more than half of small bowel tumors had aim2 mutations however aim2s established function in the cell was not in the machinery of cancer said one of the papers first authors si ming man phd a postdoctoral fellow in kannegantis laboratory rather he said aim2 was known to work in the immune system to detect invading bacteria and viruses and help alert the immune system to battle them when we found that the intestine expressed high levels of aim2 we hypothesized that this gene may also play a role in regulating gut health man said this was how we became interested in aim2 and colorectal cancer in their experiments with mice the scientists used chemicals to trigger the process mimicking the development of colorectal cancer they found that the mice showed drastically reduced aim2 function confirming the finding in humans with the cancer they also found that mice genetically altered to have reduced aim2 function when treated with the chemicals showed significantly more tumors than normal mice the scientists studies also showed that aim2 played a role independent of its immune role in suppressing abnormal expansion of intestinal stem cell populations conversely malfunction of aim2 unleashes abnormal stem cell proliferation stem cells are immature cells that differentiate into adult cells such as intestinal cells these cells continuously proliferate to replace old and dying cells in the intestine many previous studies have indicated that aim2 contributes to the immune system by acting as a pathogen sensor man said however our work is the first to identify aim2s role in controlling proliferation of intestinal stem cells this work is truly exciting to us because we have found a new role for aim2 in regulating colorectal cancer and it does so by inhibiting excessive proliferation of stem cells in the large intestine the researchers also pinpointed the specific cellular machinery regulated by aim2 they decided to explore whether aim2s protective role might involve gut bacteria based on studies from kannegantis lab and others indicating that microbial sensors similar to aim2 contributed to healthy gut microbiota indeed the comparison of gut bacteria in normal and aim2deficient mice showed a different microbial landscape in the two types of mice to test whether gut bacteria might influence the progression of colon cancer the researchers housed normal and aim2deficient mice together to enable the exchange of gut bacteria the scientists found a striking reduction in colon tumors in the aim2deficient mice and an increase in tumors in the normal mice what this might suggest is that transfer of some of the good microbiota from wildtype mice to replace the bad microbiota from mice lacking aim2 offers increased protection against colorectal cancer man said we believe that this finding has important clinical relevance because we can potentially prevent or decelerate the progression of colorectal cancer in humans especially in those who have mutations in the aim2 gene by simply giving them good microbiota we have only scratched the surface of the role of aim2 in controlling stem cell proliferation and the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota kanneganti said how exactly aim2 does both of these functions is an exciting

fake,even exercise of short duration and low intensity has life expectancy benefits for the elderly such conclusions have been well examined in the general population where a recommended exercise program of 30 minutes at least five days a week or 150 minutes per week has been shown to reduce the average risk of death by 30 percent however such a correlation between the level of physical activity and risk of death has not been so clearly determined in the elderly indeed most physical activity guidelines are the same for the middleaged adults as for the elderly even though it is estimated that over 60 of the elderly are unable to achieve this same level of exercise now a study in a french cohort of more than 1000 elderly subjects the proof study has found a negative correlation between their level of physical activity and risk of allcause death suggesting that in the elderly as in other population groups the risk of death decreases with greater and more regular exercise the results of the study are presented today at europrevent 2015 by dr david hupin from the department of clinical and exercise physiology at the university hospital of stetiennelyon france1 subjects were enrolled in the study at age 65 in 2001 and followedup for 13 years during that followup their level of physical activity was monitored and categorised according to five levels of meth values per week <1 1374 375749 equivalent to brisk walking for up to 150 minutes per week and the recommended activity level 7515 and >15 meth per week2 mortality and cardiovascular events were recorded over the followup period and associated with exercise levels results showed that around 10 of the eligible cohort died during the followup period however the risk of death was calculated to be 57 lower in those whose activity level was equal to or higher than the recommended 150 minutes per week 7515 meth per week and furthermore those doing a very low level of physical activity per week 1374 methweek had 51 lower risk of death than those doing the very minimum <1 methweek these differences in risk were statistically significant there were other significant findings too notably that starting or restarting physical activity during retirement reduced the risk of death by twothirds but in contrast any reduction even in low levels of activity exposed the elderly to a higher risk of death in commenting on the results dr hupin said several conclusions might be drawn but notably that the level of physical activity in the elderly was negatively associated with mortality rate in a dosedependent way and that even a low level of exercise below current recommendations had some protective effect as a simple rule for the elderly dr hupin recommended that at least 15 minutes of physical activity for five days a week would be a suitable first target for the elderly this could include brisk walking cycling swimming or gymnastics he suggested all possibly associated with leisure time physical activity or daily life activities dr hupin emphasised that the widespread acceptance of this message would encourage more elderly people to include even low doses of physical activity in their usual daily activities without experiencing high levels of fatigue or of pain this message should be relayed by general practitioners who play a key and essential role in promoting exercise behaviour in the elderly he said even a little is good and more may be better the findings from this proof study were confirmed in a metaanalysis preformed by the same group and reported at this same europrevent congress3 this analysis drawing on data involving almost 120000 subjects found that lowdose moderatetovigorous physical activity of say 75 minutes per week or 15 minutes per day significantly reduced mortality in the elderly based on the results dr hupin said that a revision of the recommendations for physical activity in the elderly may thus be warranted and beneficial low dose physical activity can significantly reduce mortality in this metaanalysis a low dose of activity resulted in a mortality rate reduction of 22

fake,oakland ca april 22 2015 a fruitbased micronutrient and fiberdense supplement bar the choribar conceived by drs bruce ames and mark k shigenaga at childrens hospital oakland research institute chori was shown in clinical trials to improve metabolism in overweightobese owob otherwise healthy adults in ways that are consistent with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease consumption of the bar for two months also reduced chronic inflammation and initiated a reduction in weight and waist circumference decreased inflammation and improved weight and weight distribution can lower the risk of many chronic diseases these effects occurred without requiring that participants make any change in their current diet or other lifestyle practices other than to eat two choribars each day for two months the choribar is not just another nutrition bar it is a serious intervention to improve health its composition is therefore complex and required a number of years and a series of clinical trials to develop the publication describing this work appeared online today april 22 20151 at the faseb journal the bar was developed over the past 10 years by a team of scientists led by drs bruce n ames and joyce c mccann at chori 23 in collaboration with the united states department of agriculture usda most people do not eat an optimally nutritious diet particularly the obese this results in unhealthy metabolism which not only diminishes vigor but increases future risk of many diseases while poor diets contain much that is not healthy eg too much salt sugar they also are missing or deficient in a number of important components eg vitaminsminerals omega3 fatty acids fiber necessary for healthy metabolism the choribar is intended to fill these gaps with components present in the bar in normal dietary amounts considerable evidence in the scientific literature including drs ames and mccanns work on vitamins and minerals supports the idea that simply supplying missing or deficient dietary ingredients will improve metabolism 47 development of the choribar has also been guided by dr mark shigenagas insights into the importance of a healthy gut supported by optimal nutrition for disease prevention because of the strong flavors associated with some vitamins and minerals chori partnered with the united states department of agriculture to produce a tasty bar formulation development was guided by over 15 small clinical trials to ensure that beneficial properties of the bar were retained most early trials were two weeks in length and involved primarily lean individuals most of whom benefited by increased hdl cholesterol results presented in this publication are compiled from 3 twomonth clinical trials that also included a significant number of overweightobese individuals these trials were conducted over a 4year period using very similar bar formulations these trials employed a simple economical design in which participants acted as their own controls ie change in metabolic markers was measured before and after eating the bar healthy metabolism is like a complex smoothrunning machine unhealthy metabolism is like an old machine with many rusted out joints there is no magic bullet ingredient in nutrition oiling one joint is not going to allow the rusted out machine to run the choriteam thinks the broad scale improvements observed with the choribar may be the result of oiling multiple joints by the complex nutrient mixture they are currently conducting experiments to better understand which ingredients in the bar are most important in the complex mixture for the observed effects the increasing prevalence of obesity is taking a huge toll on public health conventional approaches that encourage weight loss by improving dietary habits reducing caloric intake and modifying activity can be successful but prove difficult for many to initiate and sustain the choribar is intended as a nontraditional means to positively impact the obesity epidemic by initiating a healthier metabolism without requiring sudden drastic behavioral changes it may therefore assist in weight loss programs by beginning a process of favorable metabolic change improved metabolism resulting from eating the bar is also associated with a number of reports of feeling better though this observation has not yet been formally tested which the chori team predicts will help people transition to improved lifestyle habits the power of nutrientrich properly formulated foodbased supplements such as the choribar to move dysregulated metabolism in a healthy direction may help reverse obesityassociated conditions and thereby reduce the risk of future chronic diseases the full potential of foodbased supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated
